4/2/19, 12:05 AM - Shona 😍: 8 weeks is a long delivery for that price 🤔
4/2/19, 12:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well that's what the flight costs when it's cheapest😂
4/2/19, 12:06 AM - Shona 😍: I know. But the delivery time is too long imo.

4/2/19, 12:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As a prank
4/2/19, 12:11 AM - Shona 😍: Oh!!! Me neither! I forgot

4/2/19, 12:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know. Could not find something less  extreme but equally exciting
4/2/19, 12:13 AM - Shona 😍: Okay this is not a prank, Nelli was finally at the doctor's today
4/2/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And?

4/2/19, 12:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And her puking habits?
4/2/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: Well she might need a special diet too
4/2/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: That's not very common
4/2/19, 12:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Poor Nelli. Poor poor Nelli
4/2/19, 12:16 AM - Shona 😍: I mean looks like she will need it
4/2/19, 12:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel so bad for her
4/2/19, 12:16 AM - Shona 😍: Yes ☹☹☹
4/2/19, 12:16 AM - Shona 😍: But the meds are supposed to hlep

4/2/19, 12:17 AM - Shona 😍: That's really sweet
4/2/19, 12:17 AM - Shona 😍: I think she'd prefer the pupu :P
4/2/19, 12:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why are my eyes wet
4/2/19, 12:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😭
4/2/19, 12:18 AM - Shona 😍: Nooo baby
4/2/19, 12:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am worried for her.
4/2/19, 12:18 AM - Shona 😍: I will take care of her
4/2/19, 12:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Promise?

4/2/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
4/2/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I am overreacting
4/2/19, 12:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I really love her.
4/2/19, 12:23 AM - Shona 😍: Not in my opinion
4/2/19, 12:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Having her in my life made big changes in my thinking
4/2/19, 12:23 AM - Shona 😍: Oh?
4/2/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I am more human ever since I met her. I understand the pain of another animal. I understand their nature. I can imagine that their world is as much theirs as ours and that they deserve equal attention
4/2/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: That's quite something
4/2/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To me before that, animals were beings, but now I know that those beings have emotions values judgements and most importantly friends to be bonded with
4/2/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *they are friends to be.....
4/2/19, 12:27 AM - Shona 😍: ❤.
4/2/19, 12:28 AM - Shona 😍: They can be wonderful friends.
4/2/19, 12:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Still better than humans I suppose.
4/2/19, 12:29 AM - Shona 😍: I say they're of different kind.
4/2/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know.
4/2/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They are unconditional
4/2/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They always play with you
4/2/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They don't run away from you
4/2/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They love you deep within
4/2/19, 12:30 AM - Shona 😍: But they're also completely dependent on you
4/2/19, 12:30 AM - Shona 😍: Pets
4/2/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't mind that.
4/2/19, 12:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Even in friendship
4/2/19, 12:31 AM - Shona 😍: I think it's a different dynamic
4/2/19, 12:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. May be I am being silly
4/2/19, 12:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just mean to say they are loyal
4/2/19, 12:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hence they never backstab
4/2/19, 12:32 AM - Shona 😍: That's true
4/2/19, 12:33 AM - Shona 😍: But not all people backstab either.
4/2/19, 12:33 AM - Shona 😍: I guess it just feels safe with a pet because you can know that for sure
4/2/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/2/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think all of the people I have met in my life; _have_
4/2/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: Well now I feel like crying
4/2/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: That's awful.
4/2/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey.
4/2/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No.
4/2/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's ok.
4/2/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I gave them the reason to
4/2/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It happens to everyone I guess.
4/2/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am no exception
4/2/19, 12:36 AM - Shona 😍: I will not backstab you.
4/2/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤.
4/2/19, 12:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, some people were kind but somehow I got seperated from them
4/2/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm. Well that's a different thing then
4/2/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So now that you know this?
4/2/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will you change your mind about this? 😂
4/2/19, 12:40 AM - Shona 😍: Well it's a very different thing to be backstabbed by someone than to drift apart
4/2/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been backstabbed as well. Many a times.
4/2/19, 12:41 AM - Shona 😍: My poor baby.
4/2/19, 12:41 AM - Shona 😍: That's sad to hear.
4/2/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not
4/2/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To me
4/2/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It gave me my resilience
4/2/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's how I will always see it
4/2/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I were high someday
4/2/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And not that I am right now
4/2/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What would you want to talk to me about?
4/2/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe that's a good way to think about it now. But just makes me sad to think what people do.
4/2/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. Same here.
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can type your answer later
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona.
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I m sleepy
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Take care.
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: Go sleep darling
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are my sun
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: I love you
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are my Sunshine
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are my light
4/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For you I fight
4/2/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With all my might
4/2/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I love you
4/2/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤❤❤
4/2/19, 12:49 AM - Shona 😍: Rakkaani ❤
4/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
4/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you. Good night
4/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will dream about you.
4/2/19, 12:50 AM - Shona 😍: I love you too shona. Hyvää yötä 😘
4/2/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: Somehow I don't understand why you'd need to be high for us to talk about something, or anything. It makes me think why don't you want to talk about it when you're just yourself. Not that you're not yourself when you're high but it's different. On some level I can understand because I know that I can connect to some parts of myself when I'm drunk. But I want to be able to access those places when I'm sober too. Maybe this wasn't your point. I dunno what it is. Do you just mean deeper topics? I would want to know more about your father and how he left. I haven't quite understood what time was that in your life. And also how do you feel about that relationship. I would also like to know more about how you were as a kid. Maybe just more stories as you have told some. I would want to know more about how you became you. And more about what you want to become.
4/2/19, 9:28 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
4/2/19, 9:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning Shona

4/2/19, 9:30 AM - Shona 😍: I hope you slept well
4/2/19, 9:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well shifting the clock doesn't help the sleep cycle
4/2/19, 9:33 AM - Shona 😍: Nope
4/2/19, 9:33 AM - Shona 😍: It doesn't
4/2/19, 9:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slept fine.
4/2/19, 9:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you like crazy these days.
4/2/19, 9:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's to the point of me being dysfunctional
4/2/19, 10:16 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to say
4/2/19, 10:17 AM - Shona 😍: It breaks my heart
4/2/19, 10:33 AM - Shona 😍: The exam will be over in six weeks tomorrow. And we've done 15 weeks until now.

4/2/19, 10:42 AM - Shona 😍: It's a long time
4/2/19, 10:44 AM - Shona 😍: Almost four months
4/2/19, 11:00 AM - Shona 😍: Shona I'm really worried about you.
4/2/19, 11:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why darling?
4/2/19, 11:01 AM - Shona 😍: .
4/2/19, 11:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
4/2/19, 11:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's talk tonight?
4/2/19, 11:01 AM - Shona 😍: Let's.
4/2/19, 11:18 AM - Shona 😍: I think I will need a longer nap again today but in any case I will finish by 6
4/2/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh
4/2/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/2/19, 11:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When are you going to start?
4/2/19, 12:10 PM - Shona 😍: I had started already
4/2/19, 12:10 PM - Shona 😍: One hour done
4/2/19, 12:20 PM - Shona 😍: And I really try to be faster than that
4/2/19, 12:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/2/19, 6:30 PM - Shona 😍: I'll be done in about an hour. After that I'm all yours, when you're free.
4/2/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤
4/2/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: I'm done
4/2/19, 7:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤗
4/2/19, 7:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am so proud of you.
4/2/19, 7:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you still worried?
4/2/19, 7:49 PM - Shona 😍: Should I be?
4/2/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's not the answer to my question
4/2/19, 7:49 PM - Shona 😍: I'm very happy with the work I've done lately :)
4/2/19, 7:50 PM - Shona 😍: I know
4/2/19, 7:50 PM - Shona 😍: The thing is
4/2/19, 7:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is the graph looking like?
4/2/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know how you are. I know some, but you haven't said much, and what you have said has not sounded like you're doing particularly well
4/2/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: They're great.
4/2/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You should be concerned
4/2/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But not worried
4/2/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not doing great
4/2/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am not doing bad either
4/2/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My life is stagnant
4/2/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to talk but I am working. I want to see you while working. Is there anything you have to work on?
4/2/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: That I have understood. But why do you feel so? Because you are getting your courses done and you are gonna get the internship, so you are going forward with those things. Is it that you don't find them meaningful, and that's why it feels like your life has stagnated?
4/2/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: Oh
4/2/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: Well good that you're working.
4/2/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not learning anything new. I am not doing anything creative. I am not evolving as a person. So that to me is stagnation
4/2/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please let's not talk about it on text
4/2/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can talk on call later in the night
4/2/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: Okay. Well you're the only one who can change that. Starting to learn new things and being creative.
4/2/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/2/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry if I am being rude.
4/2/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am very angry at myself rn. I hope you understand
4/2/19, 8:08 PM - Shona 😍: You're not being rude. We can talk when you're ready :)
4/2/19, 8:11 PM - Shona 😍: I would ask why are you angry at yourself but sounds like you don't want to talk yet. So later is fine with me too.
4/2/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Free?
4/2/19, 9:26 PM - Shona 😍: Yes :)
4/2/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call?
4/2/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona. A friend is here.
4/2/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will call you in a while
4/2/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Around 30 mins at least
4/2/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: K

4/2/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A lizard got in my room
4/2/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't know how.

4/2/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey

4/3/19, 9:28 AM - Shona 😍: I love you. It's been getting quite tough. But I'll keep going 💪🏼
4/3/19, 11:11 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/3/19, 11:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I don't know what to say 😂
4/3/19, 11:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want to talk about it?
4/3/19, 11:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You somehow seem to be amused and worried at the same time.
4/3/19, 11:17 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/3/19, 11:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: are you crying?
4/3/19, 11:18 AM - Shona 😍: A bit
4/3/19, 4:57 PM - Shona 😍: I finally switched to the library, I started to feel kinda claustrophobic in my room... Feeling so much better here 🙂😅😤
4/3/19, 4:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nice.
4/3/19, 4:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow sometimes it's ok to be specific about these things.
4/3/19, 4:58 PM - Shona 😍: I guess
4/3/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: Did you continue?
4/3/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: Working
4/3/19, 4:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I did. I am in a lab though
4/3/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: Ohhh
4/3/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: Okke
4/3/19, 5:00 PM - Shona 😍: 🤓
4/3/19, 5:00 PM - Shona 😍: Have fun
4/3/19, 5:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I have a lecture after this
4/3/19, 5:00 PM - Shona 😍: 👍🏻
4/3/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Done?
4/3/19, 9:36 PM - Shona 😍: Done with bhangra too 😬
4/3/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
4/3/19, 9:36 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm hmm
4/3/19, 9:36 PM - Shona 😍: That's my line
4/3/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was Bhangra?
4/3/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am guessing good
4/3/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: Yessss
4/3/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: Feeling much better
4/3/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: How was your day?
4/3/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's not talk about it
4/3/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: Why kulta?
4/3/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: Was it bad?
4/3/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
4/3/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was the usual
4/3/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing special about it
4/3/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: Yay
4/3/19, 9:42 PM - Shona 😍: The usual
4/3/19, 9:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was studying for you?
4/3/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Not the best
4/3/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: Also, the scores are out but I don't have my paper back yet 😅 they're mailing it and I don't know when it will reach me
4/3/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: Hopefully tomorrow
4/3/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: Or on Friday
4/3/19, 9:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you don't get the scores directly?
4/3/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's written on the paper?
4/3/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: Yea
4/3/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh ok
4/3/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sup?
4/3/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: Not much
4/3/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: Just took a shower
4/3/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: I was thinking
4/3/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: What you said earlier
4/3/19, 11:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Without me?
4/3/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About?
4/3/19, 11:02 PM - Shona 😍: You wanting to talk to me when you're high. It's not that I don't like talking to you then I just hope it's not like you don't say some things unless you get high. I love you and of course you can talk to me when you're high.
4/3/19, 11:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
4/3/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: So I'm not supposed to think without you? :D
4/3/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: Or did you mean the shower
4/3/19, 11:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry, that was for the shower message
4/3/19, 11:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/3/19, 11:04 PM - Shona 😍: Unfortunately I had to take it all on my own.
4/3/19, 11:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
4/3/19, 11:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is your mood?
4/3/19, 11:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you still feel overwhelmed with all the work?
4/3/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: You say a lot of hmms today
4/3/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: No... I feel good
4/3/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: I think I shouldn't stay many days at home
4/3/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: But go to the library
4/3/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: It feels much better to be around people
4/3/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can imagine
4/3/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tell an extrovert about it
4/3/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: How is your mood Mr. Beriwala?
4/3/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
4/3/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤐
4/3/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: ?
4/3/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: 😤?
4/3/19, 11:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😶🤫
4/3/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: 👀
4/3/19, 11:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ☹
4/3/19, 11:09 PM - Shona 😍: ☹?
4/3/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ☹
4/3/19, 11:09 PM - Shona 😍: Do you want to talk about it?
4/3/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nope
4/3/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is no point in talking about it
4/3/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to think about it
4/3/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And since I am not doing that
4/3/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think I should burden you
4/3/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not exactly burdening
4/3/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I should do my thinking on my own
4/3/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I should be more responsible
4/3/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I should be more sophisticated
4/3/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That should not be the word
4/3/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know
4/3/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should we take a break?
4/3/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: Would you want to?
4/3/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well i am not discussing with you
4/3/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am not working on it either
4/3/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Each day I just call you to tell you how bad my day was
4/3/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What's the point
4/3/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I should
4/3/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not exactly following
4/3/19, 11:15 PM - Shona 😍: Working on what?
4/3/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What didn't you get. My words are pretty straightforward
4/3/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My life. The lack of purpose in it. The idleness. The boredom. The inactivity. The overweight.
4/3/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: Do you think the relationship is on the way of you getting started with things you'd want to be doing?
4/3/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course not
4/3/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If anything that's the only reason why I want to get out of bed each day
4/3/19, 11:18 PM - Shona 😍: I'm trying to understand why would you then want the break
4/3/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I hate being the man who tells you that he has done nothing the whole day only to hear that you were productive all day.
4/3/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think that helps the motivation
4/3/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I need to be by myself and think
4/3/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmmm.
4/3/19, 11:24 PM - Shona 😍: That's an interesting perspective.
4/3/19, 11:24 PM - Shona 😍: So me being productive is demotivating to you?
4/3/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think it's demotivating
4/3/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's like in a race. I definitely being the  snail and you a hare. Slow and steady is good but you are so far ahead that I am like what's the point in even trying. Also, most importantly, working 5 hours is cool but what am I supposed to work on? I don't know what's that supposed to be.
4/3/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: I'm far ahead in what? May I remind you that I'm not even in med school yet and you're almost done with your degree in engineering. And why do you think you should work for 5 hours if you don't think there's anything you need to work on atm?
4/3/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't have an answer to both of those
4/3/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I'm the sort of person who likes learning new things and keep evolving but my life seems completely stuck
4/3/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: That I can understand
4/3/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: And feeling of being stuck is no fun
4/3/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: But I hope you're not being too hard on yourself either
4/3/19, 11:40 PM - Shona 😍: Lot of things have changed for you in the last year, and especially last half a year
4/3/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How can I possibly know that?
4/3/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So they have for you as well
4/3/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: So?
4/3/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They didn't affect you? How am I any different?
4/3/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: Well beating yourself up is not useful in my opinion
4/3/19, 11:44 PM - Shona 😍: Of course they did affect. But the thing is that you  a r e  different! We are in different phases in our lives! And the change for you is different from the change for me because of the different contexts and our different backgrounds. I don't think you can compare it just like that.
4/3/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it really so? I don't think it's that different. If I plan to be in your country for the rest of my life doing a job then I can't be like this. I can't let my emotions play the trick on me. Somehow I have not been able to get a hold on them even at this fucking age of 23? And isn't that concerning?
4/3/19, 11:59 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's concerning. I think it's only human. And I think our emotions will play tricks on us for the rest of our lives, it's part of life. I think we need to learn to accept them and work with them. They will come and go. And that's fine. There's no point in focusing on how we think things _should_ be by now. If I would do that I would be very demotivated and it would have a bad effect on  my studies now. We are here were we are, and the only way out is forward. You were the one who preached to me about working with what you have and that you're good at that. I think the same applies here.
4/4/19, 12:01 AM - Shona 😍: I think you are being too hard on yourself.
4/4/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona. I don't know where I am going in life. Every career option seems unviable. Every choice seems bad. How else am I supposed to feel?
4/4/19, 12:12 AM - Shona 😍: I totally understand that it must feel frustrating! And that's okay, it is a difficult situation. I'm not saying you shouldn't feel those things. But has you being hard on yourself been working for you so far? I think some discipline is useful but beating yourself up never is.
4/4/19, 12:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know you are concerned and you want to comfort me. But only I can find a solution
4/4/19, 12:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will have to find it better
4/4/19, 12:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
4/4/19, 12:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sleepy
4/4/19, 12:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So wishes in advance
4/4/19, 12:30 AM - Shona 😍: I am concerned and I do want to comfort you. But I also really believe that being overly harsh is not a good way to go about it. These are really big questions and they won't be figured out in an instant. I think you should give it time.
4/4/19, 12:31 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
4/4/19, 12:40 AM - Shona 😍: I wish I had the time to write a summary on the book Grit that I'm listening to at the moment. It's somewhat related to these questions and I think you'd benefit from reading it.
4/4/19, 9:28 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
4/4/19, 9:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
4/4/19, 9:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just woke up myself
4/4/19, 10:06 AM - Shona 😍: So you slept quite well?
4/4/19, 10:10 AM - Shona 😍: 😚
4/4/19, 10:10 AM - Shona 😍: 😚
4/4/19, 10:10 AM - Shona 😍: Morning pucchas
4/4/19, 10:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well the quality of sleep was ok
4/4/19, 10:43 AM - Shona 😍: Okei
4/4/19, 10:45 AM - Shona 😍: Mine was of good quality but I would've liked more of it :P so maybe we balance each other out and we both slept great
4/4/19, 10:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
4/4/19, 4:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have my departmental photoshoot tomorrow
4/4/19, 4:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What do you think I should do about my moustache?
4/4/19, 4:58 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm hmm
4/4/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: How do you like it yourself?
4/4/19, 4:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I keep it for you
4/4/19, 4:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not a moustache person
4/4/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: Then shave it off Shona
4/4/19, 4:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
4/4/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: 😁
4/4/19, 5:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is it going for you?
4/4/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: Very nicely
4/4/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: 50min left
4/4/19, 5:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh!
4/4/19, 5:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you get the paper yet?
4/4/19, 5:02 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah it's been very... flowy day
4/4/19, 5:02 PM - Shona 😍: No...
4/4/19, 5:02 PM - Shona 😍: I'm at the library though
4/4/19, 5:02 PM - Shona 😍: Wouldn't know
4/4/19, 5:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/4/19, 5:06 PM - Shona 😍: I'll go finish the studying
4/4/19, 5:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/4/19, 5:14 PM - Shona 😍: But before that, I want you to know that I prefer you to do it how you like it best yourself. If you don't like the stache, don't keep it for me. I like you the best when you're comfortable yourself, stache or not. And same applies to clothes etc. If it's neutral so that you don't really care, then maybe I will say my opinion and maybe you want to do it like that then. But first do what you're comfortable with yourself.
4/4/19, 5:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So let's say I'm neutral to keeping a moustache
4/4/19, 6:10 PM - Shona 😍: Alrighty. From what you said earlier I understood that you don't like it that much yourself.
4/4/19, 6:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Done for the day?
4/4/19, 6:12 PM - Shona 😍: Yea
4/4/19, 6:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thats a record if I am not wrong
4/4/19, 6:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And may be you don't get it
4/4/19, 6:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But if we keep in mind the 3:30 time difference
4/4/19, 6:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are done by 2:30pm in the afternoon!
4/4/19, 6:15 PM - Shona 😍: It's close

4/5/19, 12:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh god

4/5/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bullshit
4/5/19, 10:43 PM - Shona 😍: This
4/5/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen to me
4/5/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What have you been doing until now?
4/5/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Studying?
4/5/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
4/5/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was also improving
4/5/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because you didn't know anything then it was improvement from gained knowledge and hence improvement
4/5/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now when you are redoing it speed
4/5/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Gets developed
4/5/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hence you are improving
4/5/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But in both cases you will say that you are improving
4/5/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or simply studying
4/5/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So the terms can be used interchangeably
4/5/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hence when they are improving
4/5/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are also improving
4/5/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And when you are only studying
4/5/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They are also just studying
4/5/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And/or improving
4/5/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like you are.
4/5/19, 10:46 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/5/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So my point is
4/5/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Simply study
4/5/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will be improvement in itself
4/5/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well you can try and increase the number of hours
4/5/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Given that you have been having very good quality hours
4/5/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can try and do more good hours
4/5/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if they are bad then stop
4/5/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>

4/6/19, 7:45 PM - Shona 😍: Okay and I'm also quite aroused atm but I don't know if I should do anything about it on my own. I mean will it make it even more difficult to do it later with you or will it help me figure out better what I like. Maybe I should just wait for later.
4/6/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. You should do it yourself
4/6/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or you will feel irritated later.

I don't think I actually could've stopped myself during it even if I'd wanted to, and that's quite something. The weekend has provided a great environment for these explorations.

4/7/19, 12:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *hey
4/7/19, 12:09 PM - Shona 😍: Okay so I’ve been thinking hard about yesterday’s topic. Like I said, looks are important to me, and I do admire a muscular or athletic physique. However, a good character is so much more important to me in a partner. I thought more about how I feel when I see good looking people. As I already mentioned, I might start smiling a lot and I do pause to admire their beauty or handsome features. I think for me it’s more about facial features than the body. Or maybe it’s how people carry themselves. I think I’ve mentioned that to me for example women without makeup look usually more beautiful to me than with makeup. I can admire good makeup too, or maybe more often it’s a somewhat neutral makeup that I think enhances someone’s features. But there’s something very mesmerizing about looking at people’s bare faces. It’s a bit difficult to explain what exactly is it, but I just really admire natural beauty. Okay a lot of talking about women here :D Maybe I’ve just been more focused on looking at women all my life. Earlier it was more like comparing myself to them or wanting to look more like someone else. These days I’ve started to really appreciate my own uniqueness and I rather focus on my good features and don’t compare it to how other people look and think I would like to look like someone else. Then I thought that maybe I care more about how I look myself than how my partner looks, or how other people look. And actually I’m not sure if that’s a good thing. I mean maybe that’s very self-centered. And I’m trying to understand what is it about me looking good that I care about. Maybe it’s partially for myself, that I like to look attractive in my own eyes. But maybe it is more for other people, because they’re  the ones who look at me more than I do. And as I myself like to admire beauty and good looks, maybe I think other people will appreciate that in me too. 
In other people I really care about what kind of a person they are. I can’t stand being around assholes, no matter how good looking they are. So even if a guy looked like a Greek god but was not a good person, I wouldn’t want to be around him, let alone in a relationship with him. The sex appeal part I’m still trying to understand better. Maybe for a small while it would feel really good to have sex with someone very physically attractive, and maybe it would make the sex better to some extent. Maybe this is the unconscious mind or primal part talking. But long term that alone would never be enough for a good relationship. So maybe consciously I then don’t want to focus on that. Hmmmmmm. Maybe there needs to be a good balance between the two. And also I’m not sure how much should we listen to the primal part of the brain. Having a holistically fulfilling life in this era… I’m not sure what all is needed and how can it be achieved. OK thinking about all this and writing about it feels like I connected to something very deep. I really like it when these kind of topics come up. Somehow also makes me want to study theology and philosophy again.

4/7/19, 4:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. I understand
4/7/19, 4:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then this is the option
4/7/19, 4:44 PM - Shona 😍: Yea..
4/7/19, 4:44 PM - Shona 😍: I just wished I could've get this over with today 😬

4/7/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am aroused
4/7/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like having phone sex with you
4/7/19, 4:47 PM - Shona 😍: I'm at Intersport atm :P
4/7/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.😶
4/7/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: And slightly annoyed by this shoe business
4/7/19, 4:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want to talk about it?
4/7/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: No use
4/7/19, 4:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok

4/7/19, 5:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Dieing to talk to you
4/7/19, 5:53 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I'm about to reach home, I gotta leave again in about 25min
4/7/19, 5:53 PM - Shona 😍: And I'm reaaaally hungry
4/7/19, 5:53 PM - Shona 😍: And grumpy
4/7/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's too bad.
4/7/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Aww. Can I do anything?
4/7/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The eternal solution perhaps.
4/7/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ?
4/7/19, 5:53 PM - Shona 😍: 🙊
4/7/19, 5:53 PM - Shona 😍: 👺
4/7/19, 5:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Y or n?
4/7/19, 6:59 PM - Shona 😍: ??
4/7/19, 7:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was in the support group meeting
4/7/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: Okkk
4/7/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Were you waiting?
4/7/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought you had a bus to catch
4/7/19, 7:25 PM - Shona 😍: I did
4/7/19, 7:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok.
4/7/19, 7:25 PM - Shona 😍: I ate for too long I missed it 😂
4/7/19, 7:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The support group meeting was nice.
4/7/19, 7:25 PM - Shona 😍: I just left
4/7/19, 7:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
4/7/19, 7:25 PM - Shona 😍: Yay!
4/7/19, 7:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Poor you. Traveling for 50 mins 😒
4/7/19, 7:26 PM - Shona 😍: 🙃
4/7/19, 7:26 PM - Shona 😍: I started to look for the shoes online
4/7/19, 7:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh?
4/7/19, 7:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why don't you delay buying the shoes and instead shop for some in India? They will be cheaper
4/7/19, 7:28 PM - Shona 😍: I kinda need them now
4/7/19, 7:28 PM - Shona 😍: I found a pair for 28e
4/7/19, 7:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nice!
4/7/19, 7:28 PM - Shona 😍: That's cheap enough
4/7/19, 7:29 PM - Shona 😍: But I just feel like so much more stuff, shoes and clothes... 😳
4/7/19, 7:29 PM - Shona 😍: Buying
4/7/19, 7:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
4/7/19, 7:29 PM - Shona 😍: I can't talk today
4/7/19, 7:29 PM - Shona 😍: Apparently
4/7/19, 7:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought what is she trying to say
4/7/19, 7:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What?!
4/7/19, 7:29 PM - Shona 😍: 😂
4/7/19, 7:30 PM - Shona 😍: This apparently
4/7/19, 7:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh ok got it
4/7/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: Please tell me I don't need more shoes than these
4/7/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't need more shoes than these.
4/7/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: I shouldn't spend more
4/7/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You shouldn't spend more.
4/7/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
4/7/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: :D
4/7/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: Very convincing
4/7/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know right?!
4/7/19, 7:33 PM - Shona 😍: You are of no help with this :D
4/7/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well you will have to talk to me more. I don't know anything about your preferences or needs
4/7/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: Äh you're right
4/7/19, 7:35 PM - Shona 😍: But I just feel like buying another pair for the spring /fall, and I kinda feel like getting boots with heels
4/7/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: And I'm trying to tell myself I don't need them
4/7/19, 7:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Get some heels. You need those
4/7/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: Or more like I shouldn't spend the money
4/7/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: My goodness
4/7/19, 7:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And get a good pair that suffices for all your casual needs.
4/7/19, 7:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What?
4/7/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: :D
4/7/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: Not what I wanted to hear
4/7/19, 7:40 PM - Shona 😍: Why didn't I have this conversation with you before I went. The sales end at aleksi 13 today...
4/7/19, 7:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know. I didn't know it was this urgent
4/7/19, 7:41 PM - Shona 😍: Yup my own fault
4/7/19, 7:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know how you mean it but it sounds pretty darn harsh.
4/7/19, 7:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't beat yourself up
4/7/19, 7:41 PM - Shona 😍: Sometimes I'm silly
4/7/19, 7:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can understand. I think we all are.
4/7/19, 7:46 PM - Shona 😍: I love you
4/7/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Where did that come from 😇
4/7/19, 7:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you too
4/7/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: https://youtu.be/AKTyPgwfPgg

4/7/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: E
4/7/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ..
4/7/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Y
4/7/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: O
4/7/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: U
4/7/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too rakas
4/7/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: You are very encouraging
4/7/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: Wow I had to run again to catch the bus
4/7/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: But I was fast with the cleaning
4/7/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I encourage you to run to catch the bus?
4/7/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: Hehe
4/7/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe so
4/7/19, 11:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always knew I will do something big
4/7/19, 11:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is it
4/7/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: :D DD
4/7/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it took you a while
4/7/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: More than 3 hours?
4/7/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: No?
4/7/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: 2h 45min
4/7/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: Bigger one
4/7/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that is still long isn't it?
4/7/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: No. That's fast.
4/7/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: Sometimes it does take more than 3h
4/7/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh ok
4/7/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: How do you think this is slow? It almost took us that long together at times
4/7/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message
4/7/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message
4/7/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message
4/7/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message
4/7/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: I saw that
4/7/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: So you want to piss me off on purpose?
4/7/19, 11:16 PM - Shona 😍: Now you were successful.
4/7/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not like that
4/7/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What I mean is that I always believe life is a sine curve but we are not following one and it worries me. We have not fought even once until now. If this good period is extending for so long then how long a bad period will we have and in that case should we just create our own small bad periods?
4/7/19, 11:24 PM - Shona 😍: Omfg
4/7/19, 11:24 PM - Shona 😍: I need a while to calm
4/7/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry if I am pissing you off more.
4/7/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I was wondering before saying these deleted messages that I have not seen you pissed off and I wanted to see you that way once as I wanted to know every side of you.
4/7/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: So you just want entertainment? Playing with my moods and emotions?
4/7/19, 11:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think it can be branded as entertainment
4/7/19, 11:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it is my genuine hunt to know you.
4/7/19, 11:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I still don't know how badly your emotions will be hurt
4/7/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: I don't buy that
4/7/19, 11:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For eg I was thinking that you will find all this funny
4/7/19, 11:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you are pissed
4/7/19, 11:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am sorry
4/7/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I really didn't mean to hurt you
4/7/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought maybe I will please you
4/7/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then we will have a good memory
4/7/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A thing to laugh at
4/7/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/7/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What can I say. I didn't think that it will be that big a deal
4/7/19, 11:58 PM - Shona 😍: Well you got me there. Too bad you're not here to see what you wanted to see. I'm so mad I'm crying rn
4/8/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. Please pick up
4/8/19, 12:13 AM - Shona 😍: Trying to do it like that and not being honest about your intentions is just pure manipulation and playing with me
4/8/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are right.
4/8/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
4/8/19, 12:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
4/8/19, 12:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please talk to me.
4/8/19, 1:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
4/8/19, 1:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry it had to be a mess in the end. Other than that I think it was a very very nice weekend. The best we have had ever since I came back
4/8/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: It was very nice indeed :)
4/8/19, 2:18 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>

4/8/19, 11:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Start
4/8/19, 11:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you.
4/8/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just was feeling anxious a little and I really felt like talking to you
4/8/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I came to the class
4/8/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I will be fine.
4/8/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Dont worry.

4/8/19, 6:24 PM - Shona 😍: How are you?
4/8/19, 6:24 PM - Shona 😍: Did you have the quiz already?
4/8/19, 6:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am ok
4/8/19, 6:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/8/19, 6:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you finish?
4/8/19, 6:29 PM - Shona 😍: How was it?
4/8/19, 6:29 PM - Shona 😍: Yea I did almost 6 and half hours
4/8/19, 6:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wtf?!
4/8/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You crazy?
4/8/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's so nice!
4/8/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am so happy for you.
4/8/19, 6:30 PM - Shona 😍: The mentor recommended I do couple extra questions if I want to get into Helsinki med school, just to be sure or something
4/8/19, 6:31 PM - Shona 😍: So I try to do that from now on
4/8/19, 6:31 PM - Shona 😍: If it seems doable
4/8/19, 6:31 PM - Shona 😍: ?
4/8/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't go. I was not feeling well.
4/8/19, 6:32 PM - Shona 😍: Oh?
4/8/19, 6:32 PM - Shona 😍: Baby are you okay?
4/8/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's a lie
4/8/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No I am not
4/8/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The truth is long and somewhat complicated
4/8/19, 6:33 PM - Shona 😍: Do you want to talk about it?
4/8/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I want to tell you.
4/8/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes! Absolutely
4/8/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Always
4/8/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No lieing to you
4/8/19, 6:34 PM - Shona 😍: Do you want to tell on call? I'll be home in a bit I don't have my headphones
4/8/19, 6:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. On call
4/8/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: I'm home I can talk when you want to
4/8/19, 6:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/8/19, 6:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will talk when I get back to my room
4/8/19, 6:55 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/8/19, 7:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can talk in text if you want
4/8/19, 7:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean about something else
4/8/19, 7:12 PM - Shona 😍: Mikko asked if someone could go pick him up from the airport after midnight. I asked if he has a lot of bags (he doesn't) and checked the buses that he could take, and I thought they were not that bad so I suggested he takes a bus. I thought I wouldn't want to compromise sleep and my schedule during the week so that my studying is not disturbed. Do you think I should go anyway?
4/8/19, 7:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you should.
4/8/19, 7:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being there for family is something one should always do. Or at least I try. I know that your schedule is important for you but it will take about half an hour. And you also love him and usually are very worried about him. This action of yours will only confuse him and distance you from him. It's a Tuesday tomorrow, so you can take a nap.
4/8/19, 7:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But still I cant tell you what to do. In my opinion you should go but we can talk about it more if you are still confused
4/8/19, 7:26 PM - Shona 😍: And this is why I asked you :) I will go.
4/8/19, 7:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I sense love in that message. Admiration maybe. Do I need to know?
4/8/19, 7:31 PM - Shona 😍: Well you sensed correctly. I asked you because I trust your judgment better in this kind of a thing. I think you are better at caring for people so I wanted to know what would you do. I would want to be better at it too.
4/8/19, 7:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am better at taking care of people 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
4/8/19, 7:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the funniest thing I have heard in days
4/8/19, 7:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂😂😂
4/8/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: Why???
4/8/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: because thats simply not true
4/8/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: Have you not met you?
4/8/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have hurt so many people in my lives
4/8/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: i hve disappointed so many
4/8/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: i have brutally crushed and walked over feelings of others
4/8/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not  even close to anything empathetic
4/8/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am with you rn
4/8/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: but i made you cry for no reason at all yesterday
4/8/19, 7:35 PM - Shona 😍: Shona I would not have decided to go if I hadn't asked you. So what does that tell you? And to me you are so loving and caring I almost can't believe my luck that I have you in my life.
4/8/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: So what? That happens. No one's perfect
4/8/19, 7:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you not remember what I concluded with that friend that day?
4/8/19, 7:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I am a horrible person and all I have done all my life is hurt others?
4/8/19, 7:41 PM - Shona 😍: Well that is simply not true. You have done anything but that to me. The small hurts are so insignificant compared to all the loving and good things you do.
4/8/19, 7:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But what of my mother
4/8/19, 7:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She is not proud of me
4/8/19, 7:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nor is my father
4/8/19, 7:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All my exes have a bad opinion of me
4/8/19, 7:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have no friends
4/8/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or at least very few
4/8/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How am I supposed to not believe this?
4/8/19, 7:44 PM - Shona 😍: Why?
4/8/19, 7:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: i dont think she is
4/8/19, 7:44 PM - Shona 😍: I have no friends. Do you think I'm a bad person because of that?
4/8/19, 7:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: she is always worried
4/8/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: she is always disapproving of my achievements
4/8/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: she is always double checking my actions by getiing them approved from others
4/8/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: fair point well made
4/8/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But...
4/8/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: you dont have friends because you dont socialize much
4/8/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: and i dont have friends because i have not been a good friend
4/8/19, 7:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can discuss those friendships on a case by case basis
4/8/19, 7:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: we can even discuss my past relationships on a case by case basis
4/8/19, 7:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: to prove that i am not a considerate/empathetic/kind/caring/good person
4/8/19, 7:49 PM - Shona 😍: I have socialized much more before. Then I mostly stopped. I have not been a very good friend either. Maybe I didn't know how to. Maybe we drifted apart.
4/8/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know all that you've done in the past. Maybe you haven't been a perfect friend or partner. But what I know is what I've seen and experienced myself. And I think you are a wonderful person.
4/8/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Your data set maybe biased 😚
4/8/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am guessing this conversation is pissing you off
4/8/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: It's not.
4/8/19, 8:09 PM - Shona 😍: But Shona I gotta leave in half an hour. I can also talk on the bus but after that I'm free only after the theater class, if you want to tell about your day
4/8/19, 8:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh. I completely forgot!
4/8/19, 8:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I guess we will talk when you get back then.
4/8/19, 8:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I am hungry and I feel like going home.
4/8/19, 8:15 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/8/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh my God. I love you a o much.
4/8/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *so
4/8/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too rakas.
4/8/19, 8:48 PM - Shona 😍: Want to elaborate on where that came from?
4/8/19, 8:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
4/8/19, 8:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I started thinking about how nice you are. How kind you have been. And not just that. When I was telling you how horrible I am. You were not ready to give up at all on your stand. It being that I am not a horrible person. For the first time I think I have seen someone believing in me that way. I have never had anyone who ever meant it. People used to say that I am special and talented etc etc but never in my life has anyone shown such belief in me. I think I was not taken aback but I feel so secure. I feel so safe. If you remember that little girl that we helped outside Subway. I feel like that girl. I feel lost. I feel there is no one to look after me. My mother is changing clothes inside and figuring her lifestyle and I am all afraid and terrified in the middle of nowhere. You make me feel loved in this world and you make me feel like someone cares. And I cannot tell you how much that means to me. Not just that, ever realized how we tend to give up our stand when we find someone totally stern on theirs? I felt like it happened to me today. I felt like maybe she is right. Maybe I am a good person. Maybe i should just shut up my negative mind and listen to her .
4/8/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona stop reading it multiple times 😁
4/8/19, 8:59 PM - Shona 😍: :D got me
4/8/19, 9:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I realized I have stopped writing the messages that I used to write for you. It was overdue. ❤
4/8/19, 9:03 PM - Shona 😍: I love you so much rakas. And I will always believe in you.
4/8/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. Should I go to the gym with that self belief? 😂
4/8/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really feel disgusted with myself for eating your head about and not doing anything
4/8/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *about this
4/8/19, 9:10 PM - Shona 😍: I was thinking about it today. And I think it would be good for you to go. No craziness needed, even if just a few times, or even once a week. It is so good for you. By now I know you like to go all in but I don't think that's necessary. No need to exhaust yourself. Just go and do something, and after a while see how it makes you feel. And if after a while you don't feel better, you can always stop going.
4/8/19, 9:12 PM - Shona 😍: And hey wasn't I supposed to be the indecisive one? Now you're not making up your mind :D
4/8/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/8/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: My point is that I think it would be really good for you. And I would love for you to do something like that that's good for you.
4/8/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: ❤.
4/8/19, 9:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: :D
4/8/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you so much. What can I say. I just love you :'(
4/8/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You make me cry.
4/8/19, 9:18 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/8/19, 9:18 PM - Shona 😍: Babyyy
4/8/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the worst. Paying for the whole year and not going. 😒
4/8/19, 9:19 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/8/19, 9:20 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂😂 I was being silly
4/8/19, 9:20 PM - Shona 😍: Beforehand I obviously thought I would go.
4/8/19, 9:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I get it
4/8/19, 9:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not saying it's your fault
4/8/19, 9:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just saying
4/8/19, 9:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That it's the worst afterthought
4/8/19, 9:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Realizing it later
4/8/19, 9:21 PM - Shona 😍: I know :D
4/8/19, 9:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I shake to my bones with the thought of it. It's pure disgust. Just absolutely pure regret mixed with guilt of money being wasted and then the lack of confidence in my decision making
4/8/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/8/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think that is exactly what is happening with the pile of books I have in my room.
4/8/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/8/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Now I feel less bad.
4/8/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was unisport! Yay!
4/8/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: Shona I gotta go!!
4/8/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/8/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: I'm late 😳
4/8/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: :/
4/8/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Never mind.
4/8/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go.
4/8/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: Talk to you later 😘😘😘
4/8/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will work for two hours
4/8/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then we will talk before sleeping
4/8/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: I love you.
4/8/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds great 👌🏻

4/8/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 915 the class gets over.
4/8/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That means the class was over 9 mins ago
4/8/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shonaaaaaaaaa
4/9/19, 12:02 AM - Shona 😍: Babyyyy

4/9/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh. Ok. :*
4/9/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: What is up?
4/9/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was desperately waiting for you
4/9/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And now that you are here.
4/9/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: Shonaaaa
4/9/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I somehow feel very complete and feel like working again
4/9/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤
4/9/19, 12:05 AM - Shona 😍: 😚😚😚
4/9/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am telling you.
4/9/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are my life.
4/9/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing will ever be life like without you.
4/9/19, 12:06 AM - Shona 😍: Rakkaani.
4/9/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby.
4/9/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking about it
4/9/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You didn't go to the gym
4/9/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: After paying for the whole year
4/9/19, 12:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe somehow it made you more depressed maybe then you didn't find life fulfilling and maybe then you decided to give up on theology and take up med school prep and maybe you then felt so overwhelmed by studying that in the hunt for fun you found the accountability group and then you found me. So maybe not going to the gym was a good decision
4/9/19, 12:12 AM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmmm. Not going to the gym happened during my first year in theology. I still stayed for the other year. But during the second year I was soooooo out of motivation... I skipped lot of classes and didn't put much effort at all in the studying.
4/9/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it is related. 😚
4/9/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What if all our lives everything that happened to us was a precursor to us meeting
4/9/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it was His plan all along the way
4/9/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like we were made in heaven or something.
4/9/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are like a dream come true. ❤
4/9/19, 12:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can totally understand if you find this stuff girly. Afterall I am the prettiest in the relationship. 😁😚😋😄
4/9/19, 12:16 AM - Shona 😍: Okay two dudes started talking to me
4/9/19, 12:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Excuse me?
4/9/19, 12:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Finally someone in Finland hit on you?
4/9/19, 12:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂😂😂😂
4/9/19, 12:21 AM - Shona 😍: No... 😬
4/9/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What about?
4/9/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, tell them you are taken
4/9/19, 12:24 AM - Shona 😍: They asked where my man is? :D
4/9/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's a smart way of asking if you are taken

4/9/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: Yes you're very pretty. Especially your eyelashes and lips are enviable.
4/9/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I sometimes fantasize about how someday I would like to sit on the bus floor where no one can see me and touch you in places that should not be touched in public.
4/9/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. I wish I could say the same about yours. 🤣
4/9/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: Fuck off
4/9/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And also, after writing this, I feel like sending you pics that I shouldn't. I know you are on the bus but some how that entices me more. 😍❤

4/9/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: Are you at the hostel?
4/9/19, 1:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/9/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: So you didn't go home?
4/9/19, 1:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I realized if I go home we won't be able to talk
4/9/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: 🤥
4/9/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: Wanna tell about your day?

4/9/19, 1:09 AM - Shona 😍: Okay?
4/9/19, 1:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The logic I give to myself is what the heck
4/9/19, 1:09 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/9/19, 1:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There are no rules

4/9/19, 1:11 AM - Shona 😍: Just lying down for a short while
4/9/19, 1:11 AM - Shona 😍: It helps
4/9/19, 1:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
4/9/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: My brain's been working all day it needs a break :D
4/9/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: Good God I'm not getting up 630 tomorrow
4/9/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: At
4/9/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh let me fuck it out of you then. 😏
4/9/19, 1:14 AM - Shona 😍: Mmmmmmmh
4/9/19, 1:14 AM - Shona 😍: Please
4/9/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. You have been getting dirty. Very very naughty.
4/9/19, 1:16 AM - Shona 😍: 😇
4/9/19, 1:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Awake?
4/9/19, 1:21 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
4/9/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: Barely :P
4/9/19, 9:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning darling
4/9/19, 9:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning Shona. So you slept two hours after I did. Huhuh. I feel... sorry for you? I don't know. I kinda feel bad giving such a recommendation. I know your schedule is very important to you. Since I am not a schedule person, I can easily mould these things for me. But anywho, the fact that you still went speaks volumes about your character. How much you love your family and what you won't do for them. I feel happy for you in that aspect. You will have them by your side when you need em. Like you had Annika that day to talk to when you were at Laura's place. Hmm, now I am wondering how it would have been like if you would have called Mikko that day. Maybe after this gesture you can someday. I am sure he will respect the favor. Well, in a family it's not a favor. These are very petty things you do for them out of love. And if that love remains then you can basically do anything- of course not everything,but-  for them. I think my Shona is that kind of a person and who will do those things and it fills my heart with warmth to see you that way. ❤
You are the most wonderful human being I have seen in my life. And the fact that I get to call you mine is sooooo ......
I don't have words. I feel very loved and secure around you. Very cared for. Like a baby. Like I always wanted.❤
4/9/19, 11:14 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning kulta
4/9/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: Rakas. It feels good to hear words of appreciation. And to know that I have you by my side. After I picked Mikko up I was feeling very stressed and restless and I was only able to sleep after 2. I woke up feeling exhausted and quite numb. I was wondering how will I get through the day like this, and I had a good cry while brushing my teeth. After that I started to feel better again and I was laughing again as I took the cold shower. Still feeling very tired but I know I can do this.
4/9/19, 11:51 AM - Shona 😍: https://youtu.be/0-0Ryu9yVQo
4/9/19, 11:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know you can. I know you will. I can imagine it is stressful. But we cannot let our eccentricities affect our loved ones. Mikko is our brother. We had to do that for him. Also, he is gonna be gone very soon forever I suppose. We owe him that. 😇
4/9/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you talk to him about Austria? On your way back?
4/9/19, 11:54 AM - Shona 😍: Some
4/9/19, 2:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey baby
4/9/19, 2:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you take a nap?
4/9/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or are you at the library?
4/9/19, 3:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/PFNdIup9kS0
4/9/19, 3:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something like I always dreamt
4/9/19, 3:36 PM - Shona 😍: No..
4/9/19, 3:36 PM - Shona 😍: I'm at home
4/9/19, 3:39 PM - Shona 😍: Huhhuh
4/9/19, 7:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/9/19, 9:19 PM - Shona 😍: What happened?
4/9/19, 9:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I gave a presentation
4/9/19, 9:20 PM - Shona 😍: How was it?
4/9/19, 9:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: People didn't like it. They were being overcritical but then this happened
4/9/19, 9:22 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. Well that must've felt nice :)
4/9/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
4/9/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: What are you up to?
4/9/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At the movies.
4/9/19, 10:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How are you?
4/9/19, 10:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was your day?
4/9/19, 10:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How were studies?
4/9/19, 10:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you do 6.5 hrs today?
4/9/19, 10:22 PM - Shona 😍: No:/ 4.8h
4/9/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wtf?! 😶
4/9/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok now I feel bad that I asked you to go. 😒
4/9/19, 10:33 PM - Shona 😍: Well my sleep times have been out of whack since Friday. I think for the last month I'll just focus on keeping the schedule and ignoring other stuff. Anyhow, I did take a 2h nap late in the afternoon. And then Laura and her friend came to pick up the car in the evening and I hung out with them for a while. And then I did couple more questions and it was past seven already and I thought one or two super crappy hours of studying won't help me in the exam. I rather stop now, go to bed early and start refreshed tomorrow.
4/9/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes I think that was a white decision

4/12/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay
4/12/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Partners in everything
4/12/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😁
4/12/19, 7:56 PM - Shona 😍: 🤨
4/12/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am trying to find a silver lining
4/12/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know there is none to this
4/12/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: 💩💩💩
4/12/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: Oh well.
4/12/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: These happen
4/12/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: Eh and I just slept one and half hours
4/12/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: Still feel tired
4/12/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What!!
4/12/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One and a half?
4/12/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What were you doing the whole night?
4/12/19, 8:00 PM - Shona 😍: In the afternoon I started to feel crazy sleepy. I took a "nap" while sitting in my chair at the library, tried coffee as well but nothing helped. I was doing physics and thought I seriously should be sleeping rn, I know all of this (the questions I was doing) so fuck it
4/12/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: Well again I didn't sleep enough
4/12/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: After we stopped talking I still had to eat and then I slept only 7 or so hours
4/12/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: And it's been like this since last Friday
4/12/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: Not enough sleep
4/12/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Am I disturbing your schedule?
4/12/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because generally that's the only thing you spend time on
4/12/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't expect this to have such an impact on me
4/12/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: But a week of crappy sleep is maybe too much
4/12/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: When doing something like this
4/12/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: I dunno 🙄
4/12/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: In the afternoon I thought I want to skip the practice exam tomorrow
4/12/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No baby
4/12/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: But obviously I won't
4/12/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't do that
4/12/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
4/12/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can stop talking if you want to
4/12/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: In that moment I was just so tired I thought it's no use
4/12/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: Noooo!!!
4/12/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: Talking with you helps
4/12/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: I just might need to be more strict with sleep times for the last month
4/12/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: I dunno it's been a weird week
4/12/19, 8:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Any other reasons that might be the cause?
4/12/19, 8:13 PM - Shona 😍: Of the tiredness?
4/12/19, 8:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And of the disruption
4/12/19, 8:13 PM - Shona 😍: Well the tiredness was the disruption
4/12/19, 8:14 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's pmsing
4/12/19, 8:14 PM - Shona 😍: I was just so crazy sleepy and it seems quite clear to me why
4/12/19, 8:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok.
4/12/19, 8:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then we will be strict
4/12/19, 8:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It maybe vitamin deficiency? Because you have been eating only sandwiches
4/12/19, 8:18 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think it would show so fast. And even if it's a factor, I have not been sleeping enough anyway.
4/12/19, 8:18 PM - Shona 😍: And I do eat vegetables in the evening and the sandwiches are whole grain 😬
4/12/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 👍🏻
4/12/19, 8:20 PM - Shona 😍: Are you gonna get high?
4/12/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know.
4/12/19, 8:21 PM - Shona 😍: I mean please don't.
4/12/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I won't
4/12/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now that you have said it
4/12/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will keep my word
4/12/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't feel like buying that book.
4/12/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now you will have to buy me that book.
4/12/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: Baby. I'm just getting worried because you've done it so often lately.
4/12/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. I understand. I won't do it darling. Don't worry. I know it's hard for you to abstain me from doing it and now that you have said it, I will respect the efforts you are putting and I will not do it
4/12/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry. I just feel like a baby crying for a toy
4/12/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I feel like I can come to you crying
4/12/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/12/19, 8:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It seems You do not like the idea
4/12/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: Putting it like that sounds somehow strange to me
4/12/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Take your time. That's how I feel.
4/12/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't change it
4/12/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was I rude?
4/12/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
4/12/19, 8:44 PM - Shona 😍: Can you explain it more? I don't understand where that's coming from.
4/12/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can. I will. Later maybe. I am studying rn.
4/12/19, 8:45 PM - Shona 😍: Okay

4/12/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel horrible rn
4/12/19, 9:36 PM - Shona 😍: Wanna talk about it?
4/12/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think you feel too good either
4/12/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I don't want to pisa you off.

4/12/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Full of energy and sadness
4/12/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And now I have to find out the reason
4/12/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/12/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: One thing I'm thinking is that please, please start some kind of exercising. It may not fix it all but I'm sure it would help at least some.
4/12/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You used to please
4/12/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it irritating you?
4/12/19, 9:43 PM - Shona 😍: What do you mean?

4/12/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
4/12/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is my not exercising and facing the same problem irritating you?
4/12/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: It's not irritating but it just seems like such an easy way to improve this that it's painful to watch when you're not doing it
4/12/19, 9:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want to call now?
4/12/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: Sure

4/13/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am ok.
4/13/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wanted to work on the project
4/13/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I have not started yet
4/13/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been working on other stuff
4/13/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And Faizal needed care
4/13/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He was hungover
4/13/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He drank last night
4/13/19, 4:47 PM - Shona 😍: Ohh
4/13/19, 5:02 PM - Shona 😍: ?
4/13/19, 5:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May I know what made you say that?
4/13/19, 5:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What?
4/13/19, 5:02 PM - Shona 😍: I saw you typing something and then you stopped :D
4/13/19, 5:04 PM - Shona 😍: Well I felt like I was being weird or annoying or something last night and you just were there with me and for me and it was really nice
4/13/19, 5:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I was being annoying myself and I really can't point a finger at you
4/13/19, 5:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been very grumpy myself lately
4/13/19, 5:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also
4/13/19, 5:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You were not being unreasonable grumpy or anything
4/13/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You were being a human. A human that I love and I will love all my life
4/13/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A human for whom I will do anything
4/13/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A human for whom I am ready to die but I won't because I choose to _live_ with her, for _always_
4/13/19, 5:08 PM - Shona 😍: ❤
4/13/19, 5:41 PM - Shona 😍: After the exam I talked with another girl whom I knew from last year. She's really nice but also she seems very... insecure. She kept talking about how she doubted herself during the exam if she'd made the right choices and how she gets discouraged when talking with people who've got really good scores. And still she'd also got great scores in the past exams. But I realized that it's quite horrible to listen to that kind of talk. I actually remembered that she was like that, and for that reason I wasn't sure if I'd want to talk with her.
4/13/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤨
4/13/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: I mean somehow that mindset can be infectious
4/13/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: To me
4/13/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: Because I think I have similar tendency
4/13/19, 5:44 PM - Shona 😍: But I've been trying to think differently
4/13/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In that case staying away is the best option
4/13/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I don't think you should worry about it mucj
4/13/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *much
4/13/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As long as I am here.
4/13/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not
4/13/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not let you think that way
4/13/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: 😚😚
4/13/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: :)
4/13/19, 5:46 PM - Shona 😍: I'm still at Otaniemi 🙄
4/13/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: Mum and dad don't pick up and I'm not sure when they're going
4/13/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: They were supposed to be ready earlier than this
4/13/19, 5:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why don't you go to A block and eat?
4/13/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not that hungry
4/13/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: I had food with me
4/13/19, 5:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the food is so tasty 😃
4/13/19, 5:48 PM - Shona 😍: I ate some more after the exam
4/13/19, 5:48 PM - Shona 😍: :D

4/13/19, 5:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you going to fill out the job applications?
4/13/19, 5:55 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think so
4/13/19, 5:55 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna go to the hospital
4/13/19, 5:55 PM - Shona 😍: Then I have the cleaning
4/13/19, 5:55 PM - Shona 😍: And the mentor's gonna call tomorrow
4/13/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She has been calling quite frequently?
4/13/19, 5:56 PM - Shona 😍: Also gotta rehearse the lines for the play, the teacher told us to know them by heart for Monday 😬
4/13/19, 5:57 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah.. She's not gonna call during Easter so that's why this call is so soon after the previous
4/13/19, 5:58 PM - Shona 😍: And I feel like doing something relaxing for the rest of the weekend, not filling applications... 😐
4/13/19, 5:59 PM - Shona 😍: I can do it on next weekend
4/13/19, 6:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why am I getting ideas? 😁
4/13/19, 6:27 PM - Shona 😍: 🙃
4/13/19, 6:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok it has been happening quite a lot lately
4/13/19, 6:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am talking sex too much
4/13/19, 6:40 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmh
4/13/19, 6:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I don't know if it's too much
4/13/19, 6:41 PM - Shona 😍: What I was thinking
4/13/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: Why do you think so?
4/13/19, 6:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Since you don't initiate it much I still have to keep the spark going
4/13/19, 6:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know
4/13/19, 6:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it's on my mind all the time and amidst your busy schedule there is no right time.
4/13/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah atm I have very little interest in initiating it. I don't have time alone these days and even last weekend... Well it was fun. But I'm still not a fan of doing it over the phone anyway
4/13/19, 6:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. You have never said that openly
4/13/19, 6:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message
4/13/19, 6:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: i was trying to sing something romantic
4/13/19, 6:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that didn't come out right 🤭
4/13/19, 6:48 PM - Shona 😍: :D
4/13/19, 6:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry❤
4/13/19, 6:49 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/13/19, 6:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does that make you sad?
4/13/19, 6:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That it might be
4/13/19, 6:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That it will never get better?
4/13/19, 6:53 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/13/19, 6:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
4/13/19, 6:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't mean to agitate you
4/13/19, 6:55 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not agitated
4/13/19, 6:55 PM - Shona 😍: I just need to speak loudly bc the traffic is noisy:D
4/13/19, 6:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm a plausible explanada

4/13/19, 7:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What do I know. You are the emoji expert. That's why I have turned to you Starlordess. This emoji is the key to the other dimension that in which our parents are about to open the door of the room in which they had laid us down to sleep but we evil sisters go out each night hunting galaxies for food. Please decide and decipher what is the code and what should we do with it to open the portal and get back to our bed.🧛‍♀️🙅🏻‍♂🙆🏻‍♂🦸🏻
4/13/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: :/ where are you?
4/13/19, 8:20 PM - Shona 😍: At the hospital!
4/13/19, 8:20 PM - Shona 😍: We just left
4/13/19, 8:21 PM - Shona 😍: You're on something again :D
4/13/19, 8:21 PM - Shona 😍: Oh no actually that's normal stuff from you
4/13/19, 8:21 PM - Shona 😍: 😚
4/13/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
4/13/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/13/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: Are you?
4/13/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yup
4/13/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: And what's that
4/13/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't be mad
4/13/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
4/13/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: You high?
4/13/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
4/13/19, 8:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
4/13/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: I kind of am. I'm having a debate with myself if it's justified or not.
4/13/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to because it is wrong
4/13/19, 8:53 PM - Shona 😍: I mean yesterday when I asked you not to get high and you said you won't, I guess you technically didn't say you wouldn't do it today 🙄 though I thought you meant that too
4/13/19, 8:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah that's what I meant. For that day. It was not like that I was never going to do it.
4/13/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah... But there's a difference though. Doing it sometimes and doing it the very next day you say that
4/13/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can we please talk about it?
4/13/19, 10:17 PM - Shona 😍: I'm cooking atm
4/14/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night.
4/14/19, 12:44 AM - Shona 😍: Good night shona
4/14/19, 12:54 AM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry I didn't talk to you. I really didn't feel like arguing tonight. It was quite spineless of me.
4/14/19, 10:51 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
4/14/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
4/14/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sup?
4/14/19, 11:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why are you not talking to me? It's a Sunday
4/14/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/14/19, 11:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why long?
4/14/19, 11:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And are you fine? I mean is your finger fine?

4/14/19, 12:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Depends if you call it an argument or a discussion
4/14/19, 12:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. You both love each other so much but there never really are any deep conversations?
4/14/19, 12:05 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/14/19, 12:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.🤔
4/14/19, 12:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To me those conversations somehow are very important.

4/14/19, 12:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona! ❤
4/14/19, 12:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shonaaaaaaaaa ❤❤
4/14/19, 12:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I need a little help.
4/14/19, 12:20 PM - Shona 😍: With?
4/14/19, 12:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am aroused and I am hanging in the middle. I need some strong visuals but I am bored of the ones I have and I am having a very strong urge to watch porn.
4/14/19, 12:25 PM - Shona 😍: That made it sound like I'm just a substitute for porn.
4/14/19, 12:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did not see that coming
4/14/19, 12:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry but I obviously did not mean that
4/14/19, 12:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But if I am aroused who will I turn to?
4/14/19, 12:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if we can't touch each other in person then how else will I do it with you?
4/14/19, 12:33 PM - Shona 😍: I know. But can you read what you just wrote?
4/14/19, 12:33 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I'm just grumpy
4/14/19, 12:33 PM - Shona 😍: I thought this is the only time I can nap today
4/14/19, 12:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. You are not. Don't blame it on your emotions. You are right that is exactly what is the jist of the message.
4/14/19, 12:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if I can't do it anyway then what I am essentially doing is that I am watching you while I am touching myself
4/14/19, 12:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if that is the case
4/14/19, 12:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then now when I am touching myself
4/14/19, 12:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just asking
4/14/19, 12:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That can I watch
4/14/19, 12:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it is just weird maybe because it's written
4/14/19, 12:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think in person its much more different
4/14/19, 12:37 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe the problem is that I don't feel like touching myself rn. As I said yesterday I'm not a fan of the phone sex. Or maybe I'm being selfish.
4/14/19, 12:38 PM - Shona 😍: Ah. I'm not in the mood atm. That's it. I wanted to sleep and not stress about phone sex.
4/14/19, 12:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: While I can't stop you from saying all these things and feeling all these things. I just don't know what to feel myself. This is so important to me as well. And of late there is never a good time to talk about these things. I am sorry darling I am trying to empathize I just don't know where it starts to turn into self sabotage
4/14/19, 12:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok ma'am I understand. But please can I ask? Are you irritated/frustrated?
4/14/19, 12:44 PM - Shona 😍: Same here. The last sentence. And for some reason the phone sex doesn't excite me at all atm. Maybe it's my mood rn, maybe it has to do with it overall. Why I now have negative feelings about it.
4/14/19, 12:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. Two people worried about self sabotage about a topic that is so important. This is a deadlock on a very very important issue at a very very wrong time and that doesn't seem good. :/
4/14/19, 12:46 PM - Shona 😍: Why is the time very wrong rn?
4/14/19, 12:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because as of now you are trying to sleep. In general you are busy with studying. Today you are busy ND next weekend you will be busy with applications
4/14/19, 12:50 PM - Shona 😍: With me the thought of self sabotage is not only with this, it's with doing stuff for other people that end up messing up my own stuff. For the past week it's been sleep. It wouldn't feel so important if it didn't have such a big effect on my studying. And I feel like saying fuck everything else I need to be able to study well for the last month.
4/14/19, 12:52 PM - Shona 😍: Also we still have unresolved stuff from yesterday which doesn't help the mood either
4/14/19, 12:53 PM - Shona 😍: I might be unreasonable rn. I don't know.
4/14/19, 12:56 PM - Shona 😍: If you're not gonna say more I'm gonna sleep, so please say if there's more you want to say rn.
4/14/19, 12:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😖
4/14/19, 12:57 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry
4/14/19, 12:57 PM - Shona 😍: It is indeed a really bad timing
4/14/19, 12:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙏🏻
4/14/19, 12:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's talk later.
4/14/19, 12:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bye Shona. Have a good nap.
4/14/19, 12:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂
4/14/19, 1:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry myself. I am being unreasonable. You haven't slept and I am being selfish
4/14/19, 1:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you.
4/14/19, 1:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If we can't do it over the phone so what
4/14/19, 1:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you and I always will come what may
4/14/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: I couldn't sleep anyway. Somehow makes me worry about the career choice. If it's gonna be any better later. Also when I see how hard time mum is having. But I also really do want to study medicine and become a great doctor. I think doctors are such badass people and I admire them so much. And I want to become that myself. I love you Shona. I'm sorry you have to go through this.
4/14/19, 3:07 PM - Shona 😍: All I would want right now is to be with you. To actually be with you.
4/14/19, 3:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I want to talk to you
4/14/19, 3:12 PM - Shona 😍: Can we talk?
4/14/19, 3:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure
4/14/19, 3:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call?
4/14/19, 3:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call?
4/14/19, 3:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's talk when you are free
4/14/19, 3:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: :'(
4/14/19, 3:44 PM - Shona 😍: :'((
4/14/19, 3:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't cry
4/14/19, 3:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry. Please don't
4/14/19, 3:45 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not. Not every weekend can be great.
4/14/19, 7:46 PM - Shona 😍: I'm free to talk when you are
4/14/19, 7:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok darling
4/14/19, 7:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you
4/14/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: 😚
4/14/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call?
4/14/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: 👍🏻
4/14/19, 8:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't feel like talking
4/14/19, 8:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😭
4/14/19, 8:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😫
4/14/19, 8:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't
4/14/19, 8:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's talk later
4/14/19, 8:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am a horrible person
4/14/19, 8:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will cheat on you someday
4/14/19, 8:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why are you even with me
4/14/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: Where is this coming from?
4/14/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am a promiscuous person
4/14/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always am checking out others
4/14/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Objectifying
4/14/19, 8:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Craving sex
4/14/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am using you as a substitute for porn
4/14/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I m a horrible horrible person
4/14/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You should leave me rn and never come back
4/14/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: Do you understand these things that you're saying?
4/14/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: This?
4/14/19, 8:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not will. *may
4/14/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: What's the difference anyway if you think you're gonna? You're the one in control of what you choose to do.
4/14/19, 8:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the thing
4/14/19, 8:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am trying to control
4/14/19, 8:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want to be that person
4/14/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the fucking reality is
4/14/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I am trying
4/14/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To control
4/14/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What if it's uncontrollable
4/14/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What if I am bound to fail
4/14/19, 8:44 PM - Shona 😍: Cheating?
4/14/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Imagine the consequences of the failure
4/14/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will break your heart
4/14/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My sexual instincts
4/14/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What if I am a wild animal who can't be tamed
4/14/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What if I am broken.
4/14/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: They are not uncontrollable. maybe some parts like checking people out are, but acting on it is a completely different thing
4/14/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: You are not.
4/14/19, 8:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I don't think if I am checking out other people then I am in control at all
4/14/19, 8:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Really?
4/14/19, 8:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Think about it. What else broken sounds like
4/14/19, 8:49 PM - Shona 😍: What is unbroken like then?
4/14/19, 8:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Look at yourself
4/14/19, 8:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is what unbroken is
4/14/19, 8:50 PM - Shona 😍: Can you be more specific?
4/14/19, 8:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being disciplined
4/14/19, 8:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Staying sobor
4/14/19, 8:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not checking out anyone
4/14/19, 8:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Reading books about sexuality
4/14/19, 8:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Feeling satiated in your ownself
4/14/19, 8:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not watching porn
4/14/19, 8:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Having no bad associations with the world
4/14/19, 8:51 PM - Shona 😍: Well that's not entirely true. I do notice good looking people.
4/14/19, 8:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No fetish
4/14/19, 8:51 PM - Shona 😍: That is something that can be learned
4/14/19, 8:52 PM - Shona 😍: I haven't been like this before
4/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No name calling
4/14/19, 8:52 PM - Shona 😍: You can do that too
4/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What have you been like?
4/14/19, 8:52 PM - Shona 😍: I've told you
4/14/19, 8:53 PM - Shona 😍: Those can be worked on. I have had them too.
4/14/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That was you just being obsessed with beauty. There was no sexual instinct involved
4/14/19, 8:54 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I was talking about the discipline part
4/14/19, 8:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know what to say
4/14/19, 8:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I dont think you get it
4/14/19, 8:56 PM - Shona 😍: Shona I quite don't. But I'm trying to understand
4/14/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am a person with very bad sexual isntincts who cannot be changed. These instincts maybe too brutal, unsexy and bad to you. While some can be changed I don't think everything can be changed or should be changed. We are very different when it comes to sexual preferences. When it comes to these choices we have to be honest if we will not be honest then we will drag the relationship to the point where it will break our hearts and dreams and lives.
4/14/19, 9:00 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I think I get it.
4/14/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: Good points.
4/14/19, 9:04 PM - Shona 😍: The truth is that I'm not very familiar with my preferences yet. I'm starting to get an idea but it's definitely not easy to explore it over the phone.
4/14/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that doesn't stop you from getting the basic idea
4/14/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You definitely are sure of a few things
4/14/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like you will never like name calling
4/14/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will never like porn
4/14/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like you will never like rough sex
4/14/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Etc etc
4/14/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the matter of fact is that I like all those things.
4/14/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How can I change everything in one aspect of my personality
4/14/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is that even permissible?
4/14/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Logical?
4/14/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or practical?
4/14/19, 9:16 PM - Shona 😍: I never asked you to change those things, for that very reason. What I told you in the very beginning was that I have a problem with porn. And I didn't want to be with someone who watches it, so the decision was up to you. Now that I've been exploring stuff, I've thought maybe some type of porn I could watch. Or then maybe not. At the moment I don't have the need or want to try. Name calling I probably won't like ever. Rough sex, I don't know. I'm not sure what you mean by that. Some spanking or other stuff, maybe, but I won't be into stuff with a lot of pain.
4/14/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well the kind we used to do in Espoo
4/14/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And maybe that is what I have been thinking
4/14/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is this thing in learning in psychology
4/14/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The classical learning method
4/14/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: These are some associations you develop between things
4/14/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like Bell for food
4/14/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And similarly some sexual drives with some sexual hints
4/14/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe you need to watch porn to learn
4/14/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe a little porn is educational
4/14/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it makes our job easy
4/14/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because as of now I really feel like your sexual problems/bottlenecks seem taller than the Everest
4/14/19, 9:21 PM - Shona 😍: The thing is I don't think porn is the best educator. Reading the book was actual education, as it was based on actual science and research. Porn might be good for getting ideas of what I might like.
4/14/19, 9:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And similarly I was thinking on those lines that since you are not comfortable with the idea of phone sex, I should go back to watching a little porn myself. It is not only convenient, it is also sufficient and stimulating. I think this time I will just have to watch out that it doesn't become an addiction again. Or maybe I shouldn't start because I am trying to end an addiction but you definitely need to start watching some
4/14/19, 9:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes, that's what I meant. Porn has categories and varieties so at least it will give you ideas of what's out there and maybe help you discover what you like
4/14/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: Please don't tell me that I need to watch it. What I can say is that I definitely am not gonna start watching it anytime before the exam. And after that, I don't know.
4/14/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You somehow seem pissed
4/14/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is that true?
4/14/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's okay for you to try to tell me what to do with this. You can suggest stuff, that's a different thing.
4/14/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why are you putting it that way
4/14/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have told you before
4/14/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's always an advice
4/14/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: That?
4/14/19, 9:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Take it or leave it
4/14/19, 9:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's upto you
4/14/19, 9:26 PM - Shona 😍: Mmh
4/14/19, 9:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I can't talk to you freely if you are going to be pissed
4/14/19, 9:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If that's what you feel we can always talk later
4/14/19, 9:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ??
4/14/19, 9:30 PM - Shona 😍: Sry just a sec
4/14/19, 9:31 PM - Shona 😍: Gotta help my parents with groceries
4/14/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/14/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/14/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand that language is important
4/14/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But what's more important is how I mean it
4/14/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I mean it like a command and say it otherwise
4/14/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then it will not help
4/14/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Words are not everything
4/14/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Especially with your partner
4/14/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They understand you enough
4/14/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To gauge you beyond your words
4/14/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also if you are busy we can talk later.
4/14/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or whatever
4/14/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/14/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/14/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can vote and then comeback
4/14/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can talk then
4/14/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/14/19, 9:49 PM - Shona 😍: I'm done
4/14/19, 9:50 PM - Shona 😍: Also I liked a lot most stuff we did when you were here
4/14/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok then we don't have a sexuality problem
4/14/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We just have a distance problem
4/14/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And we will have to manage
4/14/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the only way
4/14/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: That's it? :D
4/14/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: What were you thinking?
4/14/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well yeah. You like having sex in person
4/14/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are just not a fan of it over the phone
4/14/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Watching porn is a bad thing that I should give up
4/14/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Irrespective of your presence in my kife
4/14/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *life
4/14/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that being said
4/14/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Your presence just makes it beautiful
4/14/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both living the life
4/14/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And in improving it
4/14/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why are you quiet Shona?
4/14/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: I'm a bit astounded
4/14/19, 9:54 PM - Shona 😍: It sounded like there was a big problem and now it seems fine?
4/14/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It seems to me so
4/14/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't really crib about the fact that you can't do it over the phone
4/14/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And also
4/14/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you are sexually quite creative
4/14/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You just need your time and space
4/14/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Which is very hard but we will get it
4/14/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: After a very long time but we will
4/14/19, 9:55 PM - Shona 😍: I would think so
4/14/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please a little more hopeful
4/14/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
4/14/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am feeling very demotivated myself
4/14/19, 9:56 PM - Shona 😍: I meant the creativity part
4/14/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are doubting yourself
4/14/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you are.
4/14/19, 9:57 PM - Shona 😍: That's not a doubt
4/14/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't believe it that you are not
4/14/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are a very able girl
4/14/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A very inspiring person
4/14/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have to be.
4/14/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sure you will Google something bup
4/14/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *up
4/14/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😁
4/14/19, 9:58 PM - Shona 😍: 🙃
4/14/19, 9:58 PM - Shona 😍: Huhhuh
4/14/19, 9:58 PM - Shona 😍: The distance is...
4/14/19, 9:59 PM - Shona 😍: Tough seems like such an understatement
4/14/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It really is the toughest thing that life has asked of me until now.
4/14/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Everything seems so easy in it's light
4/14/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: That's a very strong statement
4/14/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well...
4/14/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is
4/14/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can we talk on call now?
4/14/19, 10:01 PM - Shona 😍: Yea
4/14/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry if I was being an insensitive ass. I kept talking about the therapy because it is killing me to see you that way and I feel completely helpless myself.
4/14/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's ok baby
4/14/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We all do what we see fit
4/14/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't blame you
4/14/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was being an ass myself
4/14/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am free btw. I can talk freely now.
4/14/19, 11:22 PM - Shona 😍: I'm eating atm
4/14/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You always write exactly that
4/14/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤
4/14/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are so...
4/14/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Easy
4/14/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To be with
4/14/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Consistent in yourself
4/14/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And look at me
4/14/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A quantum particle
4/14/19, 11:24 PM - Shona 😍: What do you mean by that?
4/14/19, 11:24 PM - Shona 😍: I do love my routines 😬
4/14/19, 11:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fluctuating probabistically unwanting to be found. Too hard to find too hard to gauge.
4/14/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: I have found you 🙂
4/14/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: Took me 22 years but I did.
4/14/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: :')
4/14/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. 🥺
4/14/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am a words person
4/14/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow
4/14/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometimes
4/14/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just wish
4/14/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If for once
4/14/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just for once
4/14/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I could peep
4/14/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In your heart
4/14/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And know what's in it for me
4/14/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe hear it from you
4/14/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that everytime I flinch in life.
4/14/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know those words
4/14/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That tells me
4/14/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That she is out there
4/14/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For me
4/15/19, 12:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I talk about words and you go quiet?
4/15/19, 12:23 AM - Shona 😍: Sorry Shona I was still in the kitchen
4/15/19, 12:24 AM - Shona 😍: Also you made it sound like I never say :/ which is not true
4/15/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe I could say it more often
4/15/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No baby.
4/15/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I did not mean that
4/15/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You quite often say things
4/15/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I just always crave for more
4/15/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Dont you know that about me already. 😁
4/15/19, 12:27 AM - Shona 😍: I guess.
4/15/19, 12:27 AM - Shona 😍: I feel quite empty today
4/15/19, 12:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No wonder. Your boyfriend has been very lively.
4/15/19, 12:28 AM - Shona 😍: It wasn't the easiest week
4/15/19, 12:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why don't you just say it
4/15/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let it out of your system
4/15/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That the week was awful
4/15/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was god forsaken
4/15/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Total piece of crap
4/15/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And shitty as hell
4/15/19, 12:29 AM - Shona 😍: But that's not true either
4/15/19, 12:29 AM - Shona 😍: To me
4/15/19, 12:30 AM - Shona 😍: I still did some good work and gave my everything in the practice exam
4/15/19, 12:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. True that.
4/15/19, 12:31 AM - Shona 😍: I met with my partner from the theater class on Wednesday
4/15/19, 12:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then maybe it's just your motivation levels.
4/15/19, 12:31 AM - Shona 😍: That was new
4/15/19, 12:32 AM - Shona 😍: There's nothing wrong with my motivation either I think. It is just tiring too.
4/15/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well you second guessing your career choice? Isn't that a part of motivation?
4/15/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: I was/am a bit worried about what effect it will have on me
4/15/19, 12:51 AM - Shona 😍: Shona I'm gonna sleep soon
4/15/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: I just wanted to say I really appreciated it that you let it go earlier today when I was really sleepy. That we could discuss the issue later.
4/15/19, 12:54 AM - Shona 😍: Your internet seems to be bad again
4/15/19, 12:57 AM - Shona 😍: Good night rakas.
4/15/19, 1:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby
4/15/19, 1:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
 Curious question here,
So, if like in this situation you were about to sleep by yourself and were probably wondering where I am. So in that case do you talk to yourself? That hey he is not replying so should I sleep hmm ok good night rakas and smile to sleep?
4/15/19, 1:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. A fun game. We can for a whole day live together in our house but as people who are alone and see who acts out better. So the game will be to live a whole day like you would if your partner was not home. And it will be so interesting to spend a day with you and acting the whole day like the other person is not there
4/15/19, 9:23 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
4/15/19, 9:24 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah I think I do that
4/15/19, 9:25 AM - Shona 😍: :D that's a peculiar idea
4/15/19, 10:51 AM - Shona 😍: I'm not exactly smiling though, especially if you've not been in a good mood. I'm just wondering what's going on
4/15/19, 11:09 AM - Shona 😍: Also. I'm sorry for putting it like this. I don't like how you put it either but I was out of line.
4/15/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby...
4/15/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't be sorry.
4/15/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We need to discuss it properly
4/15/19, 11:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Until then let's not conclude anything
4/15/19, 11:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ei se mitään
4/15/19, 11:10 AM - Shona 😍: 🙂
4/15/19, 11:11 AM - Shona 😍: Okay

4/15/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: I love you too.
4/15/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: I hate it where we're at rn but it will pass.
4/15/19, 11:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Me too. And yes it will pass.
4/15/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I somehow feel very happy and safe about us in the shorter run
4/15/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know how I keep saying life is a sine wave
4/15/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So if are having this prolonged low
4/15/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We will definitely have a very very long high
4/15/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤
4/15/19, 11:25 AM - Shona 😍: Because of what you said the previous week I'm not sure I agree with that. But that we should also discuss later.
4/15/19, 11:26 AM - Shona 😍: When it seemed like everything is great and you thought about creating problems
4/15/19, 11:27 AM - Shona 😍: I should start.
4/15/19, 11:27 AM - Shona 😍: Talk to you later.
4/15/19, 11:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What did I say
4/15/19, 12:27 PM - Shona 😍: This idea
4/15/19, 12:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
4/15/19, 12:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel very guilty
4/15/19, 12:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you please forgive mr
4/15/19, 12:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *me
4/15/19, 12:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been very reckless
4/15/19, 12:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel very ashamed
4/15/19, 12:29 PM - Shona 😍: Of what exactly?
4/15/19, 12:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well we were doing well
4/15/19, 12:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And somehow we managed to get here
4/15/19, 12:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
4/15/19, 12:29 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/15/19, 12:31 PM - Shona 😍: Sum of many things

4/15/19, 12:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then we will Finnish(😄) the class first
4/15/19, 12:33 PM - Shona 😍: Let's do the talking tomorrow? I don't think there's enough time in the evening to have a proper discussion
4/15/19, 12:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok baby.
4/15/19, 12:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You seem very serious
4/15/19, 12:33 PM - Shona 😍: I'm a bit sad
4/15/19, 12:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why darling?
4/15/19, 12:34 PM - Shona 😍: And again very tired
4/15/19, 12:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you not sleep well again?
4/15/19, 12:34 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't
4/15/19, 12:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But why sad darling?
4/15/19, 12:35 PM - Shona 😍: Because of what you're going through and what's going on with us
4/15/19, 12:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
4/15/19, 12:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's not good.
4/15/19, 12:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me see what I can do about it
4/15/19, 12:36 PM - Shona 😍: I should continue
4/15/19, 12:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes

4/15/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night dear
4/16/19, 1:54 AM - Shona 😍: 😬
4/16/19, 1:57 AM - Shona 😍: I miss you Kunji B. Again it feels like I don't know what's going on with you, and it's torturing to see how you're struggling these days. It must be incredibly hard for you. Feeling like you can't control your moods, wanting to escape the reality by getting high, having to lie to your mother with whom you used to be very close. Quitting watching porn and then having a girlfriend 7000km away who doesn't really like phone sex and who has very few moments alone when she could try to enjoy that with you. And who is so busy with studying and so tired that she can barely have a conversation with you in the evenings. Who seems to be putting the exam above everything else at the moment. Who many times struggles with sharing things.
Also it must be immensely stressful and frustrating not to know about the future either. And the stress of the exam week can feel overwhelming in addition to all these other things. It is a lot. 
Also. You can't change what you've done in the past, but it might feel almost unbearable to live with things you've done if you think you've hurt other people badly. I don't see other way around that but apologizing for the wrong you've done and asking the people you've hurt if there's something you can do to make things right. Beyond that, I don't think there's much to do. And you must've been hurt by other people too. There's never only one person to blame in an entire relationship. This is in response to what you told about your previous relationship(s), if that's not obvious.
4/16/19, 1:57 AM - Shona 😍: I love you kulta. Good night.
4/16/19, 9:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
4/16/19, 9:59 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
4/16/19, 11:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby?
4/16/19, 11:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How busy are you!
4/16/19, 11:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *?
4/16/19, 11:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I see you?
4/16/19, 11:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can't video call
4/16/19, 11:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A selfie?
4/16/19, 11:19 AM - Shona 😍: Just got on the bus
4/16/19, 11:19 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/16/19, 11:19 AM - Shona 😍: I'm slightly late
4/16/19, 11:20 AM - Shona 😍: I gave myself extra 30min for sleep 😬
4/16/19, 11:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know if you will get it but my reaction to this was:
4/16/19, 11:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😖+😇
4/16/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: Care to explain?
4/16/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😖 because I am sad because I miss caressing your face
😇 Because I feel so blessed having touched it in the past. Having kissed it. I feel so lucky because it reminds me of how we were together and what we have is so special, despite the distance. I feel blessed to have you in my life and to see you prosper. I feel so... privileged to keep your back.
4/16/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have the most caring eyes
4/16/19, 11:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You look so mature. In a good way. In a lady like way. Confident and yet tender.
4/16/19, 11:25 AM - Shona 😍: 🥰🤭🤗
4/16/19, 11:39 AM - Shona 😍: I actually thought you were busy yourself. Also it's probably an introvert thing that I still have the feeling I shouldn't message if I don't have something specific to talk about. And we actually have a lot to talk about but those conversations shouldn't be started in the morning.
4/16/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you have any idea how many times I have messaged you without a topic in mind😃
4/16/19, 11:40 AM - Shona 😍: I know!
4/16/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do yourself a favor
4/16/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Next time you feel like talking
4/16/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just say Hi
4/16/19, 11:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And say i have nothing to say
4/16/19, 11:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will take it on from there.

4/17/19, 4:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well there is more to it
4/17/19, 4:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can't force me. If I don't tell you what I am upto then how can you help me
4/17/19, 4:24 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think stubborn is a right word
4/17/19, 4:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I don't follow what we decide
4/17/19, 4:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then it's not your fault
4/17/19, 4:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can be a little strict
4/17/19, 4:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe that's your fault

4/17/19, 6:11 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna meditate a bit
4/17/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why dear? Any problem?
4/17/19, 6:22 PM - Shona 😍: The same thing. I've had a little trouble focusing lately. Stress and not being able to fully relax even at night
4/17/19, 6:22 PM - Shona 😍: Starting to really feel it
4/17/19, 6:23 PM - Shona 😍: But meditation seems to help when I do it
4/17/19, 6:23 PM - Shona 😍: I feel better already

4/17/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh.
4/17/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am guessing the class was good?
4/17/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: The teacher was 30min late 😂😂😂
4/17/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Indians I tell you 😅
4/17/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So the class stretched 30 mins after that right? Or was it a 30 mins class only?
4/17/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: He said he first thought it starts at 7 😅
4/17/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: 30min class...
4/17/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: We practised without him beforehand
4/17/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh?
4/17/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That must have been nice.
4/17/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I were a part of your class then it would have totally been my idea😅
4/17/19, 9:42 PM - Shona 😍: Well we were not gonna waste the time for sure!
4/17/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
4/17/19, 9:49 PM - Shona 😍: It was so much fun though! He taught us a one minute coreography and it was nice to see how a different teacher does it
4/17/19, 9:49 PM - Shona 😍: Soooooooo fun
4/17/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad that you enjoy it so much.
4/17/19, 9:50 PM - Shona 😍: 💃💃💃💃💃💃
4/17/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really enjoyed studying with you today as well
4/17/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was so much fun. I got a shit tonne done. Which gives me ample time to relax in the exams.
4/17/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: That's great!!
4/17/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thank you for being there Shona.
4/17/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: Did you continue after the extra break?
4/17/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thank you for being in my life and enlightening it
4/17/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: 💥💥💥
4/17/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I studied for half an hour.
4/17/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then me and Faizal ate some more
4/17/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I came home

4/17/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: Yay
4/17/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It somehow took me an hour. Was a 15 mins job really :/
4/17/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Omg I was sweating so much
4/17/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaa

4/17/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This was the message I was typing as a joke!
4/17/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Omfg

4/17/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you;
4/17/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: !
4/17/19, 9:59 PM - Shona 😍: 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
4/17/19, 9:59 PM - Shona 😍: I love you kultasieni
4/17/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Kultapieni
4/17/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭
4/17/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: 🍄
4/17/19, 10:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As you can see
4/17/19, 10:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: These things mean a lot to me
4/17/19, 10:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙆🏻‍♂
4/17/19, 10:02 PM - Shona 😍: 🤔
4/17/19, 10:08 PM - Shona 😍: Also I'm gonna get bangs after all 😁
4/17/19, 10:09 PM - Shona 😍: I booked the time for Friday
4/17/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How come?
4/17/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Maybe I shouldn't be saying
4/17/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just am the kind of person who discusses these things
4/17/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: What do you mean?
4/17/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ?
4/17/19, 10:13 PM - Shona 😍: I just thought about it more, I was a bit bored of my hair now and I thought about my facial structure more
4/17/19, 10:14 PM - Shona 😍: ???
4/17/19, 10:15 PM - Shona 😍: Wasn't sure what did you mean by that this time. Thinking the same thing?
4/17/19, 10:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know how I discussed the moustache etc etc. I just thought that you would have discussed it before getting the bangs. I know you don't have to and you are free to decide these things but I just wish you would have told me. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind this- you deciding on your own. I just prefer that- you discussing it with me.
4/17/19, 10:16 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmmm
4/17/19, 10:17 PM - Shona 😍: You did discuss the stache but you didn't say anything before cutting your hair though 🤔
4/17/19, 10:17 PM - Shona 😍: And we have been discussing the bangs already
4/17/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not sure how I feel about that
4/17/19, 10:22 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand why you  might feel that way. I guess it still is such a strange idea to me. To discuss such a thing with you... Or someone
4/17/19, 10:24 PM - Shona 😍: Also you said the moustache is neutral to you, that it doesn't really matter to you
4/17/19, 10:29 PM - Shona 😍: Okay is it so that you'd like to be informed about the decision before I take action?
4/17/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am little busy
4/17/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want to rush with this conversation
4/17/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can we please take this up later?
4/17/19, 10:30 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
4/17/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a very important conversation
4/17/19, 10:30 PM - Shona 😍: Sure!
4/17/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am very sorry Shona.
4/17/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Family time 🤕
4/17/19, 10:31 PM - Shona 😍: It's fine!
4/17/19, 10:31 PM - Shona 😍: 🙂
4/17/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not everything but something big like this. I mean, I am not going to discuss what I am going to wear but if I am going to buy a costly suit then I will definitely ask for opinion. Similarly getting bangs is like a big thing, it will probably take you what 4 months to grow your hair back? So that definitely makes it a big thing and I will really appreciate it if you could discuss these things in advance. Of course that being said, I want you to be comfortable with all this. I don't want you to feel overwhelmed with social anxiety. Just  take your time and let me know how you feel about it.
4/17/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. What a day!
4/17/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Barring a small portion- which I could have easily done- I was able to finish everything in psychology. Huhuh. I didn't expect that. Thank you so much my sun. 🙂 Tomorrow, I will finish that small portion and will work on the project. Having gone through the chapters in psychology, I think I have a better idea about what I want to say about digital introspection. At least I will not feel FOMO. 😁 I also spent some quality time with my family so that was also very nice. Also, some time with Faizal. Wwow I had a nice day! I am so excited about your bangs and I can't wait for the exams to get over. And you forgot to call the agency! Never mind. I am sure it's above 96% :* I miss you my darling but having worked with you like I always wanted makes me miss you less. Hmm. Is this the purpose my life was waiting for? Maybe. I don't know. I will have to think about it. I live you minä kultapieni. <3
4/17/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby? Busy?
4/18/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: Kinda
4/18/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: Gotta finish some chores
4/18/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok darling.
4/18/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night Shona.
4/18/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you Babu
4/18/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 💌
4/18/19, 12:03 AM - Shona 😍: Good night love!
4/18/19, 12:55 AM - Shona 😍: So maybe I didn't think getting bangs is such a big thing. If I were to dye my hair neon green or get a pixie cut, that would be a big thing imo. But getting bangs or cutting it a bit shorter, I don't think it's such big of a deal. And as I said, it didn't seem to be that important to you either since you didn't  mention anything before cutting your own hair that you'd been growing for months.
4/18/19, 12:57 AM - Shona 😍: But otherwise I too think important things are good to discuss beforehand. Maybe we just think a bit differently what is a big or an important thing exactly.
4/18/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: Great job Shona!! I'm glad you had such a nice day :) Also I did call the agency but they didn't pick up, I waited several minutes on the line. Hmm maybe I'll try again a bit earlier tomorrow. It was nice working with you too even though you started slacking in the middle of it 😁 Well I know I'm a bit of a
4/18/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: ... Nazi when it comes to schedules and sticking to plans.
4/18/19, 1:03 AM - Shona 😍: woops I'm typing this on the computer so I sent that too early
4/18/19, 1:03 AM - Shona 😍: but whatever
4/18/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: Good night darling 😚
4/18/19, 6:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fair point
4/18/19, 6:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. Sure.
4/18/19, 6:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's called being a Finn 😁
4/18/19, 9:29 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning kulta
4/18/19, 9:30 AM - Shona 😍: 😬
4/18/19, 9:31 AM - Shona 😍: To add to this, I think we will also learn over time what the other one sees as important
4/18/19, 12:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/18/19, 12:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have no idea what I just went through today
4/18/19, 1:40 PM - Shona 😍: What happened Shona?
4/18/19, 1:40 PM - Shona 😍: Btw I got the results from last exam by email!
4/18/19, 1:50 PM - Shona 😍: You were right, my rankig was over 96%! Even though I still doubted it myself.
4/18/19, 1:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay!
4/18/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have got to give me a treat now!
4/18/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call please?
4/18/19, 2:55 PM - Shona 😍: Heya

4/18/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤😍
4/18/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you took another break hmm 🙂
4/18/19, 5:58 PM - Shona 😍: Shona I take several breaks during a day 😁
4/18/19, 6:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I was not sure if you take too many long breaks and you did
4/18/19, 6:01 PM - Shona 😍: Not too many
4/18/19, 6:01 PM - Shona 😍: Enough
4/18/19, 6:02 PM - Shona 😍: In the afternoon it's more difficult to focus anyway
4/18/19, 6:03 PM - Shona 😍: Anyhow, I'mma do the last session
4/18/19, 6:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I so want to do a masters in psychology
4/18/19, 7:16 PM - Shona 😍: Oh!!
4/18/19, 7:16 PM - Shona 😍: Please do that
4/18/19, 7:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it's not a viable option
4/18/19, 7:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to earn
4/18/19, 7:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Psychology has no money
4/18/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: MBA has
4/18/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also you were to send me the options for English masters in psychology at tampere
4/18/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or turku
4/18/19, 7:17 PM - Shona 😍: Psychologists do make money??
4/18/19, 7:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not in India they don't
4/18/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/18/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: In Finland the average is 3600e/month
4/18/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: Yas
4/18/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: Äh dang it. You were right. It was so that you could study psychology in English independently in Tampere
4/18/19, 7:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So no masters of psychology in Finland
4/18/19, 7:27 PM - Shona 😍: So it seems. The course materials are mostly in English though, I guess in all the psychology programs. But that's it.
4/18/19, 7:47 PM - Shona 😍: Are you busy?
4/18/19, 7:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry baby somehow missed your message
4/18/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: That's fine
4/18/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: But that was a separate question
4/18/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
4/18/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well. I am not.

4/18/19, 8:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My brother asked why did I not fill the application yet😟
4/18/19, 8:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I am having dinner now. So it will take me 20 mins.
4/18/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: So you did not? Why? And is this an application that you need for the internship you're gonna get or something else?
4/18/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was slacking. I don't have any reason. If I do give any reason then that will be me just making excuses.
4/18/19, 8:54 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/18/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am on it. I am going to do it right away
4/18/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought I may not have the documents
4/18/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I do
4/18/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So yay

4/18/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/18/19, 10:13 PM - Shona 😍: Also. I really hope that we can eventually find something with psychology for you. Being excited and truly enjoying what you do for a living or study is so important.

4/18/19, 10:17 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe so! I've actually felt like I've been in the state of flow during the last practice exams. My nerves are exactly the part that I feel worried about.
4/18/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: But why US?? There are many universities in Europe too where you could study in English.
4/18/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: That would be closer, if you really wanted to pursue psychology

4/18/19, 10:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona you seem pissed
4/18/19, 10:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it so?

4/18/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: Why do you think that?
4/18/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know. This emoji came late.
4/18/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I thought
4/18/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: Because of slapping?
4/18/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You actually are disgusted to the point
4/18/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you want to slap me
4/18/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: No
4/18/19, 10:51 PM - Shona 😍: If I was disgusted I wouldn't use this 😚
4/18/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
4/18/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call?
4/18/19, 11:18 PM - Shona 😍: Ei armoa Tuiskulle
4/18/19, 11:18 PM - Shona 😍: No mercy for Tuisku

4/18/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ei armoa Tuiskulle
4/18/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: Studying more while working does not seem that strange to me. And people live their lives meanwhile. Mum and dad got married while she was still specializing, and mum had Laura and me before she finished it.
4/18/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: 😅😅😂
4/18/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm

4/18/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just am unsure of the uncertainty
4/18/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really felt like we will spend some quality time together
4/18/19, 11:52 PM - Shona 😍: Why do you think there would not be quality time??
4/18/19, 11:52 PM - Shona 😍: It's not like in the US here
4/18/19, 11:52 PM - Shona 😍: Not such crazy hours
4/18/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean after the first 6 years
4/18/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
4/18/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/18/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you

4/19/19, 12:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel utterly frustrated
4/19/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey

4/19/19, 12:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was this rude? I am sorry if it was
4/19/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: Hey

4/19/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night then
4/19/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't comment it to you
4/19/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I was saying it to myself
4/19/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I was being rude to myself
4/19/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think I am sorry about that
4/19/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, in that case you can't really say I was being rude to you.  Because honestly I wasn't
4/19/19, 12:42 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah whatever. It wasn't nice to hear.
4/19/19, 12:43 AM - Shona 😍: I probably don't have anything constructive to say atm
4/19/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I am sorry. I will be more careful next time.

4/19/19, 11:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In that moment was a mystery true.
Murdering my soul in hiding,
Searing my heart in two.

Touching my heart with thunder,
You did a gruesome blunder.

 smitten by your beauty,
From Hence it is my duty.

To rinse you with my feelings,
Of the rues and the reelings.

So now, my darling, I ask you..
 in me will you enshrine?
  until that heart of thine, ever so fine, 
  finds a place in this ravern supine, 
  with your soul ashine? 
  So that Our heart and Our souls doth align. 
  From now and unto eternity. 
  Will you be mine?

4/19/19, 12:48 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I actually don't know if they say that
4/19/19, 12:48 PM - Shona 😍: But happy Good Friday
4/19/19, 12:49 PM - Shona 😍: I mean I'm not sure if happy is a good word to use 😅
4/19/19, 12:49 PM - Shona 😍: Anywhoo
4/19/19, 12:49 PM - Shona 😍: I should continue

4/19/19, 1:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
4/19/19, 1:51 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I figured this might be pms. I'm gonna have my period in a week and some extra tiredness may be a symptom. Also I've been crying when I hear some moving stuff :D
4/19/19, 1:51 PM - Shona 😍: Heyyy
4/19/19, 1:51 PM - Shona 😍: How's it goin?
4/19/19, 1:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
4/19/19, 1:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Slow.
4/19/19, 1:51 PM - Shona 😍: Same here 😬
4/19/19, 1:52 PM - Shona 😍: What are you studying?
4/19/19, 1:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Finally writing the digital introspection essay
4/19/19, 1:52 PM - Shona 😍: Ooooh!!
4/19/19, 1:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. I am torn between two things
4/19/19, 1:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want it to be goof
4/19/19, 1:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *good
4/19/19, 1:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I don't want to complicate it
4/19/19, 1:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am afraid if I will write something too easy then the professor will not write it
4/19/19, 1:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *like
4/19/19, 1:54 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. Can you make changes after he reads it?
4/19/19, 1:54 PM - Shona 😍: In case he finds it too easy
4/19/19, 1:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/19/19, 1:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can.
4/19/19, 1:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean it's not like I have to nail it in the first draft
4/19/19, 1:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can make changes in the middle
4/19/19, 1:55 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
4/19/19, 1:55 PM - Shona 😍: Well that's good
4/19/19, 1:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know. I will have your opinion as well.
4/19/19, 1:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will you have time in the evening?
4/19/19, 1:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To read it once?
4/19/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: I think so
4/19/19, 1:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Please don't cry after reading it. Although I doubt if it will be moving
4/19/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: :D
4/19/19, 1:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did the poem make you cry?
4/19/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: I probably will then
4/19/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, what is moving to you!
4/19/19, 1:57 PM - Shona 😍: No. I was feeling quite numb earlier
4/19/19, 1:57 PM - Shona 😍: Still am a bit
4/19/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I feel quite fat. I can literally feel the stretch on my belly
4/19/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should we do something about it? Or wait for it to pass?
4/19/19, 1:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Another fun game. We can. Someday read our old messages to each other out loud. Like acting them out or something. How fun will that be!
4/19/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: Well what I've cried about earlier was stuff in the audiobook. Once when Michelle described the moment when Barack won the election and another time when she was visiting a war veteran in the hospital. The veteran was very badly injured but still tried to get up to salute the firat lady
4/19/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/19/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: It'll pasd
4/19/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: Hahhaha yes
4/19/19, 1:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wow! You typed that fast.
4/19/19, 2:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shonaaaaaaaaa
4/19/19, 2:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Your typing speed increased!
4/19/19, 2:00 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. The ideas were clear in my head
4/19/19, 2:00 PM - Shona 😍: That made it easier
4/19/19, 2:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/19/19, 2:00 PM - Shona 😍: Shona fo to the gym then please. It will make you feel better
4/19/19, 2:00 PM - Shona 😍: Go*

4/19/19, 2:01 PM - Shona 😍: True
4/19/19, 2:01 PM - Shona 😍: 👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
4/19/19, 3:16 PM - Shona 😍: Sometimes I'm afraid I will ruin things with my Finnish coldness. Have I told you how much I love and admire the warmth that you have? And the family centeredness in your culture
4/19/19, 3:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Babyyy
4/19/19, 3:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call for 10 mins?
4/19/19, 3:17 PM - Shona 😍: 5mins 😬
4/19/19, 4:37 PM - Shona 😍: Did you start writing yet?
4/19/19, 4:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/19/19, 4:39 PM - Shona 😍: Awesome
4/19/19, 4:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How has it been going for you?
4/19/19, 4:41 PM - Shona 😍: Still crazy tired and horny too 😅
4/19/19, 4:41 PM - Shona 😍: But I've accepted this day is like this
4/19/19, 4:42 PM - Shona 😍: I'll do what I can
4/19/19, 4:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Same here. I am not in the best of my moods. Maybe it is the topic itself. I have been delaying it for over 6 months now. I have not associated good feelings with it. At all. 🤕
4/19/19, 4:46 PM - Shona 😍: Aaaah that delaying is awful. I can imagine it makes it feel so much worse. But the sooner you get it done the better!
4/19/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am going to get it done today and thats it.
4/19/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No delaying it any further
4/19/19, 4:47 PM - Shona 😍: Great. I'm looking forward to reading it.
4/19/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh you will like it
4/19/19, 4:47 PM - Shona 😍: :)

4/19/19, 4:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will this look good on me?
4/19/19, 5:22 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. I'm personally not a fan of those kind of jumpsuits. So I probably can't objectively say if it will look good 😬
4/19/19, 5:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How come you are using the phone in the middle of your studies?
4/19/19, 5:24 PM - Shona 😍: I took a nap
4/19/19, 5:24 PM - Shona 😍: On my chair
4/19/19, 5:24 PM - Shona 😍: Srsly the fatigue is insane today
4/19/19, 5:26 PM - Shona 😍: Previously I probably would've just taken the day off when I've felt like this
4/19/19, 5:26 PM - Shona 😍: But I'm gonna do some more.
4/19/19, 5:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay!

4/19/19, 5:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am trying to keep it very casual
4/19/19, 5:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want it to be a easy read.
4/19/19, 5:28 PM - Shona 😍: Alrite
4/19/19, 5:29 PM - Shona 😍: Ok. Back to electron diffraction and Bragg's law.

4/19/19, 5:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😗
4/19/19, 7:27 PM - Shona 😍: On my way to the hairdresser now 😬

4/19/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It turns out I won't be able to finish it today. But I have made decent progress and will most probably be able to finish it tomorrow
4/19/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I need to go out with a friend and help him shop. So I will be out for a while
4/19/19, 9:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Quick question
4/19/19, 9:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did she burn your hair?
4/19/19, 9:26 PM - Shona 😍: No but GODDAMN IT SHE CUT IT TOO SHORT
4/19/19, 9:29 PM - Shona 😍: I'm really really really pissed right now
4/19/19, 9:31 PM - Shona 😍: Should've paid more and gone to a better one
4/19/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Never mind darling. You will grow them
4/19/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't be pissed
4/19/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This might be one of those moments when you can cool yourself off by being a little rude.
4/19/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to do
4/19/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: I feel like abusing
4/19/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe punching something
4/19/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: Siis voi helvetin helvetti miten voi leikkaa noin metsään????

4/19/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok.
4/19/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
4/19/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't mean it that way
4/19/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not upset because of that
4/19/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: But because of what she did to my hair!!!!!!!
4/19/19, 9:42 PM - Shona 😍: It could've been sooooo good
4/19/19, 9:42 PM - Shona 😍: But she butchered it
4/19/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't say that.
4/19/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Your over criticizing
4/19/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me see.
4/19/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will tell you the truth
4/19/19, 9:42 PM - Shona 😍: I should've gone to the one I know from before
4/19/19, 9:43 PM - Shona 😍: It does not matter if you like it or even if it looks good if it's not the vision that I had
4/19/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: God

4/19/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well please don't do that
4/19/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: While it looks so good on me
4/19/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think you can pull it off
4/19/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is a bit out of your league 🧐
4/19/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: ✂✂✂✂✂
4/19/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>

4/19/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I guess I should stay quiet
4/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: I really don't know what to do with myself 😂
4/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: It's kinda close to what I wanted
4/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: But
4/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: But
4/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I just gotta learn how to style it
4/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: And let it grow a bit longer
4/19/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I'm slowly starting to like it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

4/19/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exactly how _I_ imagined
4/19/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not sure what you envisioned
4/19/19, 10:41 PM - Shona 😍: A tad bit longer, and maybe slightly lighter
4/19/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No baby. They look perfect
4/19/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just wish if you had round glasses.
4/19/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It would have looked really good.
4/19/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Check if you have a frame in the house
4/19/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please try it on.
4/19/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: Are you still shopping?
4/19/19, 10:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. Done.
4/19/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: Did you find what you were looking for?
4/19/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I was not shopping for myself
4/19/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it took him time
4/19/19, 10:59 PM - Shona 😍: I know

4/19/19, 11:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/19/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Took him quite a while.
4/19/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was hard
4/19/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He was not coming up with ideas
4/19/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ND was rejecting mine.
4/19/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: Well worth it if he found something good
4/19/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/19/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: Difficult to shop then
4/19/19, 11:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/19/19, 11:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ?
4/19/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: No one has round glasses
4/19/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/19/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: And thank God I don't need ones

4/19/19, 11:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it was certainly not a good Friday for you then 😅
4/19/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I'm not gonna even begin with anything about the good Friday. I'm not gonna speak about what happened to me today in the same sentence with what took place on the day we're remembering with the good Friday
4/19/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: But no, wasn't the best of my Fridays 😁
4/20/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: https://youtu.be/zDS4PIKw1m4

4/20/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a question
4/20/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: Shoot
4/20/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was today one of those moments in which you had nothing to say but still wanted to talk but was wondering if you should message and I might be busy and hence you didn't message?
4/20/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: Hmmmm
4/20/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: Perhaps
4/20/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: It was a strange day
4/20/19, 1:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't we decide that you will at least indicate in such situations that you feel like talking but have nothing to say?
4/20/19, 1:16 AM - Shona 😍: Aaaaaah
4/20/19, 1:16 AM - Shona 😍: I guess
4/20/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok.
4/20/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have nothing more to say
4/20/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry if I push you too much
4/20/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I just so want to focus on your f your feelings
4/20/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to say to the voice in my head that says the opposite
4/20/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: It seems to win most times
4/20/19, 1:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
4/20/19, 1:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry for being harsh
4/20/19, 1:20 AM - Shona 😍: Okay that didn't seem harsh to me
4/20/19, 1:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The tone of this in my head was
4/20/19, 1:21 AM - Shona 😍: I see
4/20/19, 1:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Am I disturbing your sleep
4/20/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I ask you to change the veto am I changing you too much
4/20/19, 1:24 AM - Shona 😍: The veto?
4/20/19, 1:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The apparent power tussle in which the voice of your head wins hence has the veto- a symbol of power
4/20/19, 1:26 AM - Shona 😍: Some change is good and this is something like that. Something I would like to change, to some extent at least.
4/20/19, 1:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it's a very core characteristics attitude to you. It just feels like a part of your central core values and a typical part of your identity. Changing it just feels wrong. Intuitively!
4/20/19, 1:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ?
4/20/19, 1:29 AM - Shona 😍: It is definitely not of my core values. If I feel like reaching out and I know it would make me feel better, I should learn to do it. If I really want to be on my own, then that's fine, it doesn't need to be changed. Both of these happen
4/20/19, 1:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Then I guess next time when I will feel like that you are feeling like that you feel like talking then I will tell you to tell me that you feel like talking and then when you will tell me that you feel like talking then the next time you will feel like talking you will be able to tell me that you feel like talking.
4/20/19, 1:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
4/20/19, 1:32 AM - Shona 😍: :DDD
4/20/19, 1:32 AM - Shona 😍: Shona
4/20/19, 1:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please laugh. If that didn't make you laugh then I am not sure if I can keep you happy
4/20/19, 1:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣😅
4/20/19, 1:32 AM - Shona 😍: I love you.
4/20/19, 1:33 AM - Shona 😍: You are silly. You are the best.
4/20/19, 1:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you.
4/20/19, 1:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You want to hear our love story?
4/20/19, 1:33 AM - Shona 😍: And yes I'd like to sleep 😬
4/20/19, 1:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: :')
4/20/19, 1:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/h5h_EW4odWw
4/20/19, 1:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Night= to the dark light of the cafe that we were in.
4/20/19, 1:34 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/20/19, 1:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen to it please and imagine the day we first met
4/20/19, 1:34 AM - Shona 😍: I will.
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: Good night shona
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😟
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: I really need to sleep
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: It will pass
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I was so excited
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wanted you to listen to it now.
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: And then I don't know when I can
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok.
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go.
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Babu
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bye
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you Shona
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: Don't be sorry
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go .
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: I love you
4/20/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sweet dreams
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sleep tight
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Shona 😍: Hyvää yötä
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't let the bed bugs bite
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Shona 😍: 😘😘😘😘
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Asta la vista
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Shona 😍: I won't
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bueno noches
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hyvä yötä
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: शुभ रात्री
4/20/19, 1:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/20/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: 😚😚😚😚
4/20/19, 1:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😉
4/20/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: शुभ रात्री
4/20/19, 1:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go
4/20/19, 9:50 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning shona
4/20/19, 10:24 AM - Shona 😍: Wow:D
4/20/19, 10:24 AM - Shona 😍: I see what you meant
4/20/19, 10:35 AM - Shona 😍: Also it was a genius idea to put the lamp on the wall. It's the perfect spot! Doesn't take space on the table and it looks cool. I put it on every morning when I sit at my desk and plan the day.
4/20/19, 10:35 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know if I've said that before 😅
4/20/19, 11:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/20/19, 11:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you still following a schedule like a robot? 😒
4/20/19, 11:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean it's a weekend
4/20/19, 11:28 AM - Shona 😍: No I just woke up at almost the same time, without the alarm 😬
4/20/19, 11:29 AM - Shona 😍: Guess my body is used to it
4/20/19, 11:29 AM - Shona 😍: How did you sleep?
4/20/19, 11:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was ok
4/20/19, 11:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Have I ever told you
4/20/19, 11:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How much I love you?
4/20/19, 11:30 AM - Shona 😍: Babyyy
4/20/19, 11:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I cried yesterday
4/20/19, 11:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was listening to a song
4/20/19, 11:30 AM - Shona 😍: Why??
4/20/19, 11:31 AM - Shona 😍: Oh
4/20/19, 11:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it reminded me of us
4/20/19, 11:31 AM - Shona 😍: Which song?
4/20/19, 11:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of my life in Finland
4/20/19, 11:31 AM - Shona 😍: ❤.
4/20/19, 11:32 AM - Shona 😍: ?
4/20/19, 11:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/e9cefe-xD04
4/20/19, 11:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just close your eyes
4/20/19, 11:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Lie down
4/20/19, 11:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And listen to it
4/20/19, 11:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On the best pair of headphones you have got
4/20/19, 11:33 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/20/19, 11:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/O0H8bk7JKMY
4/20/19, 11:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe you can listen to this.
4/20/19, 11:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is shorter and better.
4/20/19, 11:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't have much memories associated with it.
4/20/19, 11:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 11:38 AM - Shona 😍: Uuuuuuuuuuh 😍😍
4/20/19, 11:39 AM - Shona 😍: Looking real good Shona
4/20/19, 11:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought so. :|
4/20/19, 11:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought you will like it
4/20/19, 11:39 AM - Shona 😍: Why :|
4/20/19, 11:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry wrong one
4/20/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: :)
4/20/19, 11:40 AM - Shona 😍: :))
4/20/19, 11:40 AM - Shona 😍: )))
4/20/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mich you
4/20/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to kiss your chin
4/20/19, 11:40 AM - Shona 😍: Mich
4/20/19, 11:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: mich you
4/20/19, 11:41 AM - Shona 😍: I mich you too
4/20/19, 11:42 AM - Shona 😍: Last night I was able to relax before sleep, I just thought about how it felt like to lie next to you. And it really helped!
4/20/19, 11:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thats a really big statement
4/20/19, 11:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean
4/20/19, 11:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It means a lot to me
4/20/19, 11:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: and I know it means a lot to you
4/20/19, 11:43 AM - Shona 😍: It does.
4/20/19, 11:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Every second of my life
4/20/19, 11:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have only one thought
4/20/19, 11:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How can I be more close to you
4/20/19, 11:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe this is good
4/20/19, 11:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The distance
4/20/19, 11:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It tells me in its own way
4/20/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That there is more to life
4/20/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd that not every action can mean to be about this
4/20/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe that every action can
4/20/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But not in the same way as it would if I were to be there in person
4/20/19, 11:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So the magnitude of each step in the light of coming closer to you changes
4/20/19, 11:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But still in its infinitesimally small way that it brings me closer to you
4/20/19, 11:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will keep trying
4/20/19, 11:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Even from being so far off.
4/20/19, 11:49 AM - Shona 😍: I'm trying to take that in
4/20/19, 11:49 AM - Shona 😍: To really understand how you feel and think about it
4/20/19, 11:51 AM - Shona 😍: Many times it's difficult for me to understand. But at times when I pause to really think it's like I can get it
4/20/19, 11:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can ask me anything
4/20/19, 11:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can explain
4/20/19, 11:52 AM - Shona 😍: I think the distance does good too.
4/20/19, 11:54 AM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's necessarily about you explaining it more, though sometimes it is. I think it's more that I really stop and think everything that I know about you and then in that light understand.
4/20/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok then stop:p
4/20/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And think
4/20/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will ask you questions after an hour
4/20/19, 11:54 AM - Shona 😍: 😂😂😂
4/20/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will be an hour long test
4/20/19, 11:54 AM - Shona 😍: Good God
4/20/19, 11:55 AM - Shona 😍: Exams never end for me
4/20/19, 11:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All single option correct multiple choice questions
4/20/19, 11:55 AM - Shona 😍: :D
4/20/19, 11:57 AM - Shona 😍: I love you
4/20/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't
4/20/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I live you
4/20/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 💌
4/20/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And now she is like. What's wrong with him why does he do that
4/20/19, 11:58 AM - Shona 😍: Nah
4/20/19, 11:58 AM - Shona 😍: I'm used to it by now 😁
4/20/19, 11:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you know how nice a texter you are?
4/20/19, 11:58 AM - Shona 😍: Actually I don't
4/20/19, 11:59 AM - Shona 😍: I never text with myself
4/20/19, 11:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I literally abhor people who use acronyms
4/20/19, 11:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Use LOL for showing how funny something is
4/20/19, 11:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Use shitty spellings
4/20/19, 11:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And never engage in a conversation
4/20/19, 12:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They just keep saying syllables like yes no tell me more etc etc
4/20/19, 12:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You on the other hand are such a nice texter
4/20/19, 12:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Honestly
4/20/19, 12:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is a pet peeve
4/20/19, 12:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am so glad I have you
4/20/19, 12:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Texting with you is so much fun
4/20/19, 12:01 PM - Shona 😍: Well don't you think it's also about the person you text with
4/20/19, 12:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It may also be a deal breaker
4/20/19, 12:01 PM - Shona 😍: Not only about the style
4/20/19, 12:01 PM - Shona 😍: But how you feel about the person
4/20/19, 12:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not necessarily, some people are awesome to hang out with but terrible texters.
4/20/19, 12:01 PM - Shona 😍: Oho :D
4/20/19, 12:01 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/20/19, 12:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have had very good friends with whom I never text
4/20/19, 12:02 PM - Shona 😍: Well texting is quite an important part in our relationship at this point :D
4/20/19, 12:03 PM - Shona 😍: We don't have many options
4/20/19, 12:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will always be
4/20/19, 12:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will keep writing to you
4/20/19, 12:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Poems like thesr
4/20/19, 12:03 PM - Shona 😍: ❤❤
4/20/19, 12:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: lived, I have but in futility all the while,
my life, it seemed, like  an exile,

Until the day it happened; that meet,
With you, I was, in a moment so sweet,

I found a place for my heart to reside,
With My worries I could alas incide.

To know and not this smile of you,
In that moment was a mystery true.
Murdering my soul in hiding,
Searing my heart in two.

Touching my heart with thunder,
You did a gruesome blunder.

 smitten by your beauty,
From Hence it is my duty.

To rinse you with my feelings,
Of the rues and the reelings.

So now, my darling, I ask you..
 in me will you enshrine?
  until that heart of thine, ever so fine, 
  finds a place in this ravern supine, 
  with your soul ashine? 
  So that Our heart and Our souls doth align. 
  From now and unto eternity. 
  Will you be mine?
4/20/19, 12:06 PM - Shona 😍: Rakas. I will be yours.
4/20/19, 12:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Out of words?
4/20/19, 12:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I say something?
4/20/19, 12:12 PM - Shona 😍: Please
4/20/19, 12:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just don't think anyone is ever out of words. What I suspect is that the other person maybe so full of words that they see everything that comes to there mind as too much and thus irrelevant or so much that difficult to make sense of all at once and hence they dont say anything or may be what comes to your mind is in Finnish so you are not able to articulate it in English.
4/20/19, 12:16 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe so. But the language doesn't seem to be that much of a problem. Hmm except for yesterday when I was raging about the hair
4/20/19, 12:17 PM - Shona 😍: I mean not a problem like before
4/20/19, 12:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I can see that
4/20/19, 12:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby.
4/20/19, 12:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So can you please tell me how you feel about this?
4/20/19, 12:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If language is not a problem then please write whatever comes to your mind.
4/20/19, 12:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/j1Aq-4hiIhQ
4/20/19, 12:35 PM - Shona 😍: Well I feel like disagreeing with the first verse, I wouldn't want to think you've lived in futility before we met. I'm happy to hear you found the place for your heart to reside. I want to be a safe place for that.
I don't understand why your heart was seared into two and why was your soul murdered. And why was touching your heart a gruesome blunder? Then I like the idea of you rinsing me with your feelings, it's very sweet.
I didn't understand the word ravern, nor did my dictionary. Aligning our hearts and souls is a beautiful idea but it also makes me think what does that actually mean.
4/20/19, 12:36 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 12:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 12:36 PM - Shona 😍: Well that's what I thought???? You asked what comes to my mind
4/20/19, 12:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/20/19, 12:38 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I'm just not that much of a romantic when it comes to poetry 🤔 It did feel like I was doing a poem analysis
4/20/19, 12:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well isn't it a common metaphor in poetry in which love sears your heart? It sure is in the Hindi poetry and the Shakespearen plays that I have read and also Cupid's arrows, aren't they a part of the same metaphor.
4/20/19, 12:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exactly my point.
4/20/19, 12:39 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm okay
4/20/19, 12:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is supposed to bring a rush of feelings in your heart and not instead trigger your high school brain giving an English exam
4/20/19, 12:39 PM - Shona 😍: But that's what mostly happens 😅
4/20/19, 12:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At least that was my intent behind writing it
4/20/19, 12:40 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand that and I get it that it is important to you
4/20/19, 12:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe it's not your fault. Maybe it's a cultural thing. maybe it is something we are conditioned to. You know, finding it romantic when someone writes a poem. maybe that's not a default reaction.
4/20/19, 12:44 PM - Shona 😍: It definitely is a difference between us. Maybe it's culture, maybe just about personality. Brings to my mind a book I read about different love languages. For some people words are more important, for some time spent together, for some acts of kindness or service, for some physical touch or for some it's gifts.
4/20/19, 12:45 PM - Shona 😍: Well that went a bit on a tangent
4/20/19, 12:45 PM - Shona 😍: But I have thought about it before too
4/20/19, 12:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What book is that?
4/20/19, 12:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I need to read it
4/20/19, 12:45 PM - Shona 😍: The five love languages
4/20/19, 12:45 PM - Shona 😍: By Gary Chapman
4/20/19, 12:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I get a selfie?
4/20/19, 12:47 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah it was good in it's own way, one method of improving or navigating relationships
4/20/19, 12:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When did you read it by the way
4/20/19, 12:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am guessing before you were in this relationship
4/20/19, 12:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And in that case
4/20/19, 12:47 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 12:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Who were you reading it for?
4/20/19, 12:48 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm couple years ago
4/20/19, 12:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What relationship were you preparing for?
4/20/19, 12:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
4/20/19, 12:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤
4/20/19, 12:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You look soooooo nice!

4/20/19, 1:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You really are getting your way with words.
4/20/19, 1:03 PM - Shona 😍: We can talk about it on call if you can't make sense of it 😂
4/20/19, 1:05 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 1:06 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 1:13 PM - Shona 😍: 😳😳😳
4/20/19, 1:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why did you have a crush on him? If I may ask. I mean. Was it because of his looks? Or because is actions were benign?
4/20/19, 1:16 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 1:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I please see him?
4/20/19, 1:17 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 1:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fuck! That's deep. I am so glad you told me.
4/20/19, 1:19 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah...
4/20/19, 1:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow you have been so perfect with your motivation these days that you feel like a goddess or something and then I just am amazed. This makes me realize that you are also human.
4/20/19, 1:22 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 1:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 1:38 PM - Shona 😍: Very well put :)
4/20/19, 1:42 PM - Shona 😍: Although when you say that it makes me more curious about your past
4/20/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The reason why I ask is that I want to know what looking good means to you.
4/20/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can ask. I will feel less burdened.
4/20/19, 1:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always feel you will leave me if you were to know.
4/20/19, 1:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I will be less afraid
4/20/19, 1:44 PM - Shona 😍: But Shona I've told you I don't have just one type that I like. And last time I saw him was last summer, and I wasn't really attracted to him anymore :D
4/20/19, 1:44 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm so maybe better if you do tell then
4/20/19, 1:46 PM - Shona 😍: But you can find him on Facebook? I don't have any pics of him. His name is Tuomas Lukkaroinen
4/20/19, 1:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Quite a name. 😁
4/20/19, 1:48 PM - Shona 😍: It's very Finnish 😁
4/20/19, 1:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. Muscular. Big eyes. Strong jawline and a very pretty smile.
4/20/19, 2:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. You are quiet. Did I say something wrong?
4/20/19, 2:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby?
4/20/19, 2:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mine is better. Tuisku Kettunen
4/20/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: No
4/20/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: I wasn't sure what to say
4/20/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: Then I vacuumed 😅
4/20/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: I mean what am I supposed to say when you analyze his looks?
4/20/19, 2:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Way to go. When you don't know what to say just vaccum. Lovely! 😒
4/20/19, 2:12 PM - Shona 😍: Well I was also kinda waiting for you to say something more
4/20/19, 2:12 PM - Shona 😍: But yeah not the best thing to do, you're right
4/20/19, 2:13 PM - Shona 😍: ?
4/20/19, 2:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Whether or not you really like those features?
4/20/19, 2:14 PM - Shona 😍: For the love of God
4/20/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I get it maybe I am pushing it
4/20/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry
4/20/19, 2:15 PM - Shona 😍: I do like those features! I also like other kind of features!
4/20/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry Shona.
4/20/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't be maf
4/20/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *mad
4/20/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I get it
4/20/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was wondering when you sent that long message
4/20/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That looks are not something you really look forward to in a person
4/20/19, 2:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For you his actions maketh a man
4/20/19, 2:17 PM - Shona 😍: Which one?
4/20/19, 2:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 8 mins.
4/20/19, 2:17 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
4/20/19, 2:17 PM - Shona 😍: Well it is the combination!
4/20/19, 2:18 PM - Shona 😍: Actions and looks
4/20/19, 2:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
4/20/19, 2:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Babe. Please don't be mad. I am just trying to understand from a cognitive perspective how you perceive things.
4/20/19, 2:19 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not mad, I just don't understand what more you want to hear
4/20/19, 2:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it that frustrating?
4/20/19, 2:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The questions
4/20/19, 2:20 PM - Shona 😍: It feels a bit like it's the same conversation once again
4/20/19, 2:21 PM - Shona 😍: Can you maybe be more specific then with your questions? If there's something you still don't understand
4/20/19, 2:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 2:25 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmmmm
4/20/19, 2:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just had some very very very very very very very very very tasty lunch😍
4/20/19, 2:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Babyyy. You know what. I am in looooove with you. Of the kind in which I want to pluck the stars from the nightline and use them to decorate your veil.
4/20/19, 2:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. You were saying something and now you are quiet. Whenever I say something and it is an independent line then first finish what you are saying and then reply
4/20/19, 2:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 2:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 2:39 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I think too much, but I don't think everything I've ever wanted is something constant... It seems like it has changed to me over time. Or maybe that just means that I'm still trying to understand it myself. But maybe this helps you to understand. When I was younger, I always dreamed of being with a dark man. Most of my crushes have been on men from other ethnicities. Maybe it was also about the warmth that I sensed already back then. Maybe it was the excitement over something unfamiliar... I also loved to read fiction back then, and some of my favorites were with someone traveling to another land. And in my daydreams it was always someone from a foreign country. I dreamt of a faraway land with a man from that country.
4/20/19, 2:41 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 2:42 PM - Shona 😍: That's awesome 😁
4/20/19, 2:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No it's not cheesy. It is exactly what I was craving for since so many days!!!!!!!!🙆🏻‍♂😳😳😳😳
4/20/19, 2:43 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaaaa!! That's great 🥳🥳🥳🥳
4/20/19, 2:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I use those fucking exclamations so much that now when I want to stress on my point I can't use them enough?
4/20/19, 2:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *!
4/20/19, 2:43 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too 😙
4/20/19, 2:44 PM - Shona 😍: :D
4/20/19, 2:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 2:46 PM - Shona 😍: It kinda feels difficult to even explain how deep these desires went. Maybe I somehow let them go at some point, thinking it's too... Or somehow out of my reach
4/20/19, 2:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But yet it feels so real to explore these sides of you right?
4/20/19, 2:48 PM - Shona 😍: Babyyyyyy ❤❤❤
4/20/19, 2:49 PM - Shona 😍: Kind of strange too
4/20/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/20/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That too.
4/20/19, 2:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have in the past really liked the idea of galloping somewhere
4/20/19, 2:52 PM - Shona 😍: I have
4/20/19, 2:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So.. you really want that and so do I. ❤
4/20/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But there is a problem
4/20/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Whenever I think of such a place
4/20/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always feel there will be no Amazon delivery
4/20/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how will I order my gadgets then
4/20/19, 2:54 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂
4/20/19, 2:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I am sure by now you know how big a gadget freak I am
4/20/19, 2:55 PM - Shona 😍: You gotta make your own I think
4/20/19, 2:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah. Too lazy for that.
4/20/19, 2:55 PM - Shona 😍: Yes I have noticed
4/20/19, 2:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I guess I will every now and then just go to the nearest city and get all at once.
4/20/19, 2:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then spend days exploring those gadgets.
4/20/19, 2:56 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds like a plan
4/20/19, 2:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't mind that?
4/20/19, 2:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will not be pissed if I spend our money on expensive gadgets?
4/20/19, 2:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like the new Samsung Galaxy Fold?
4/20/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: What is that
4/20/19, 2:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't you see my status?
4/20/19, 2:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The one that I posted
4/20/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm no
4/20/19, 2:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What I want for my birthday?
4/20/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: Whaa
4/20/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: No
4/20/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/VSqkL31w69k
4/20/19, 3:00 PM - Shona 😍: Goodness
4/20/19, 3:01 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm maybe I will be 😬
4/20/19, 3:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I _will_ buy that 🧐
4/20/19, 3:02 PM - Shona 😍: That's worth of three or four months rent for example 😅
4/20/19, 3:02 PM - Shona 😍: 😁
4/20/19, 3:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. But it is so cool 😅
4/20/19, 3:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh my God that's true.
4/20/19, 3:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I shouldn't be buying expensive gadgets
4/20/19, 3:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I like them so much 😟
4/20/19, 3:04 PM - Shona 😍: Well sometimes they might be useful
4/20/19, 3:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can we talk on call video? 📹🤳🎦🎥
4/20/19, 3:05 PM - Shona 😍: And I get it that it might not be only about it being useful
4/20/19, 3:05 PM - Shona 😍: Sure
4/20/19, 3:05 PM - Shona 😍: Call video
4/20/19, 3:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://www.vrlively.in/Default.aspx#H_I_W
4/20/19, 4:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Macquarie
4/20/19, 5:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 6:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
4/20/19, 6:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I ate
4/20/19, 7:00 PM - Shona 😍: Hej
4/20/19, 7:00 PM - Shona 😍: Me too
4/20/19, 7:00 PM - Shona 😍: And talked with mum
4/20/19, 7:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About?
4/20/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: She was feeling stressed about Mikko's graduation celebration, more specifically about the food what will be served
4/20/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: So we discussed that
4/20/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: We're gonna order most of the things from a catering service
4/20/19, 7:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will it be a house party?
4/20/19, 7:06 PM - Shona 😍: House party as in a party at our place?
4/20/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: The ceremony will be at the school but the party after that at our place
4/20/19, 7:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/20/19, 7:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So everyone who graduates throws a party at their place?
4/20/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: That's the most common thing to do
4/20/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe some people rent a place
4/20/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: Or do something else
4/20/19, 7:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I didn't know graduation was such a big deal 😅
4/20/19, 7:09 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm it kinda is here :D
4/20/19, 7:09 PM - Shona 😍: Don't you throw any parties when someone graduates?
4/20/19, 7:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well college graduation is but not Class 12th board exams
4/20/19, 7:11 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/20/19, 7:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When I completed class 12
4/20/19, 7:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mom was like
4/20/19, 7:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok good
4/20/19, 7:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now study for the entrance
4/20/19, 7:12 PM - Shona 😍: 😅😅😅
4/20/19, 7:15 PM - Shona 😍: I'm processing everything you told me earlier
4/20/19, 7:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Anything you want to want me to answer?
4/20/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: I think no, for now
4/20/19, 7:24 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 7:25 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 8:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have an interesting proposition.
4/20/19, 8:09 PM - Shona 😍: Please tell
4/20/19, 8:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I will tell it on call
4/20/19, 8:18 PM - Shona 😍: Well wanna tell it now?
4/20/19, 8:19 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know at what time Laura will come
4/20/19, 8:19 PM - Shona 😍: But I won't be free in the evening then
4/20/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The book I have in mind is the power of Habit
4/20/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: By Charles Duhigg
4/20/19, 8:28 PM - Shona 😍: Sure!
4/20/19, 8:28 PM - Shona 😍: Let's do it
4/20/19, 8:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course the audio book will fo
4/20/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *do
4/20/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can send you a pirated copy
4/20/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: ....
4/20/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you are going to order it
4/20/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: Not a fan of the idea
4/20/19, 8:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
4/20/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Audio book it is then
4/20/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't worry you can tell me what part you like and I will mark it for you in my book
4/20/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With a red highlighter❤
4/20/19, 8:45 PM - Shona 😍: 😘
4/20/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok never mind. I will wait
4/20/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or should I start reading!
4/20/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: You can!
4/20/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not getting it to work
4/20/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: Rn
4/20/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should you call the customer care?
4/20/19, 9:22 PM - Shona 😍: Also not related to this but the earlier topic. You said that it is a big deal that you cleared the JEE exam, and I understood that. You said that Sukriti (I don't know how to spell it) fell for you after she found that out and that's what I found strange. That it was only about that. Maybe it wasn't but that's how you made it sound. My point is that I hope you didn't get me wrong, I do find something like that hot too. I think it was and is really hot that you're an engineering student. And I admire clearing an exam like that too. I don't know if I have actually said that before. But that's only one factor to me among others.
4/20/19, 9:22 PM - Shona 😍: I dunnoo...
4/20/19, 9:22 PM - Shona 😍: 🙄🙄🙄🙄
4/20/19, 9:22 PM - Shona 😍: Getting a bit frustrated
4/20/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
4/20/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's interesting
4/20/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you please call them? I am just getting started and I will really like to come together 🤭
4/20/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well she also found me very hot. She was obsessed with my looks.
4/20/19, 9:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that brings me to an interesting point. Should I just drop everything and aim for top schools like Harvard/Princeton/Oxford etc for my masters. Because certainly Brand value is something
4/20/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Until now I was thinking that the relationship is more important but I guess it can wait
4/20/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: For what is brand value something? Getting a job?
4/20/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No, it is a thing in itself. It projects itself in myraid ways. In job applications in life confidence in impression management in one to one conversations in personality development
4/20/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
4/20/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: What do you mean by dropping everything? And when? After you graduate in December?
4/20/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. After I graduate in December
4/20/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Dropping the plans of doing a job in the longer term. Dropping the plan of moving in with you asap and of MBa
4/20/19, 9:49 PM - Shona 😍: I see. And to study psychology?
4/20/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: PhD in psychology or masters. Whichever I can get
4/20/19, 9:49 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/20/19, 10:15 PM - Shona 😍: I think doing the things you find meaningful is most important
4/20/19, 10:17 PM - Shona 😍: If that means getting an education from such a school, then that's the way to go
4/20/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a good news.
4/20/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok I don't have it yet
4/20/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will have it in half an hour.
4/20/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
4/20/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: Okay?
4/20/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please wait
4/20/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will be a good news
4/20/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: 👍🏻
4/20/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: So do I get to hear the good news?
4/20/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes you do
4/20/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I finished the first chapter
4/20/19, 11:16 PM - Shona 😍: Awesome!!
4/20/19, 11:16 PM - Shona 😍: How did you like it?
4/20/19, 11:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well. I read a blog about the book yesterday so I knew most of the stuff
4/20/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At least the real stuff and the rest was storytelling
4/20/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I could see what the writer was trying to do 😅
4/21/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is Laura already here?
4/21/19, 12:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *there
4/21/19, 12:33 AM - Shona 😍: Okay 😬
4/21/19, 12:33 AM - Shona 😍: Yup
4/21/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
4/21/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Another good news
4/21/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you guess?
4/21/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: You finished another chapter?
4/21/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yup!
4/21/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: Hyvä Shona!!!
4/21/19, 12:36 AM - Shona 😍: Did you know most of that stuff too?
4/21/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/21/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Plus he is telling about psychology
4/21/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Which I usually know
4/21/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I really feel good about myself
4/21/19, 12:36 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/21/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: I can imagine
4/21/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night I guess.
4/21/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wanted to talk to you more.
4/21/19, 12:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May be I am being obsessed
4/21/19, 12:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know.
4/21/19, 1:00 AM - Shona 😍: Me too. But I'm having family time rn, we're playing trivial pursuit :)
4/21/19, 1:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always ask you to spend time with family. While my heart always wants you to stay
4/21/19, 1:16 AM - Shona 😍: Shona you're my family too. But tonight I'm with this one :)
4/21/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
4/21/19, 2:13 AM - Shona 😍: Good night darling
4/21/19, 3:07 AM - Shona 😍: Today's conversations were tough. In these kind of situations I would really like to have close friends to talk to. To get some advice from outside of myself and us. I do have books written by relationship experts but sometimes I really hope I had people to talk to, whose advice I could trust. Maybe somebody much older actually, who has a lot of experience. Someone who I could look up to. Well. Maybe just a faraway role model will have to do. I've been talking about Michelle Obama as I've been listening to the audiobook and I really admire her in many ways. Having a career while raising kids, and being a supportive wife to an insanely busy husband.  Not complaining and having an amazing attitude about all of it. Being a really hard worker and very intelligent. Being warm, kind and compassionate, and also knowing how to have fun.
All of that makes me go wow.
I aspire to be something like that myself one day.
4/21/19, 3:07 AM - Shona 😍: I love you Shona.
4/21/19, 3:07 AM - Shona 😍: Good night.
4/21/19, 3:10 AM - Shona 😍: Mmh also! About my schedule tomorrow. I'm gonna finish some applications in the morning and half past one I'm gonna drive Mikko to work and go do the cleaning. You have the exams to study for, and still the introspection project to finish. So you will be busy too. I couldn't get the audiobook to work yet... Let's see if I can fix that tomorrow.
4/21/19, 3:11 AM - Shona 😍: 😘
4/21/19, 9:30 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
4/21/19, 10:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning. I wish I could chuck everything and just talk to you.
4/21/19, 10:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you like crazy.
4/21/19, 10:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/21/19, 11:32 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/21/19, 11:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't like the idea at all do you?
4/21/19, 11:49 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe I don't see the usefulness of that for everyday life
4/21/19, 11:49 AM - Shona 😍: Also I'm in the planning and working mode 😬
4/21/19, 11:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was the application filling?
4/21/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: Have not done it yet. Rn I'm trying to figure out some kind of a budget for living on my own. Like how much should I even work
4/21/19, 11:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh.
4/21/19, 11:51 AM - Shona 😍: Also my computer is not working 😅
4/21/19, 11:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh?
4/21/19, 11:51 AM - Shona 😍: So I haven't been able to start
4/21/19, 11:51 AM - Shona 😍: It's updating...
4/21/19, 11:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/21/19, 11:52 AM - Shona 😍: But it's been doing it for a looong time now
4/21/19, 11:52 AM - Shona 😍: So I dunno if it's gonna work
4/21/19, 11:52 AM - Shona 😍: Yay it started!
4/21/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/21/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. I miss you. But I should be studying. What should I do?
4/21/19, 11:57 AM - Shona 😍: Go study Shona. You have the exams next week. You'll be less stressed if you have started preparing earlier. And I need to fill the applications too, I can't talk.
4/21/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😟
4/21/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/21/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am going to do an hour session
4/21/19, 11:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See you then. Let's see how much I can finish by then
4/21/19, 11:58 AM - Shona 😍: Great!
4/21/19, 11:58 AM - Shona 😍: All the best 💪🏼
4/21/19, 12:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Huhu
4/21/19, 12:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 2 hours of studying done.
4/21/19, 12:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🧐
4/21/19, 1:00 PM - Shona 😍: 2 hours!! Wow
4/21/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: I finished and sent the first application 😁
4/21/19, 1:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you work out the finances?
4/21/19, 1:19 PM - Shona 😍: Well I don't know the rent, I don't really know how much the groceries will be... And student loan is an option too. I can't make a cler plan before knowing the actual expenses. So I think I'm just gonna try to work as much as possible during that month. More savings will give me more options then. And a month is a very short time anyway
4/21/19, 1:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/21/19, 1:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/21/19, 1:22 PM - Shona 😍: I think it has to do with me having a clear idea in my head
4/21/19, 1:22 PM - Shona 😍: If I don't need to think much it's faster
4/21/19, 1:22 PM - Shona 😍: Also I don't have the plaster in my thumb anymore
4/21/19, 1:22 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
4/21/19, 1:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
4/21/19, 1:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Omg I miss you
4/21/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: Babyyy
4/21/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: I'm almost done with the second application
4/21/19, 2:12 PM - Shona 😍: Gonna go through it once more
4/21/19, 2:12 PM - Shona 😍: But first I'll eat something 😬
4/21/19, 2:12 PM - Shona 😍: How's it going for you?
4/21/19, 2:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just started again
4/21/19, 2:12 PM - Shona 😍: Yay!
4/21/19, 2:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will be done with this unit in an hour.
4/21/19, 2:13 PM - Shona 😍: That's so great!
4/21/19, 2:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is about nano fabrication. I know most of the stuff. Then there will only be one unit left. That I have done once. So I am on track.
4/21/19, 2:15 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds really cool though I have no idea what that is 😁 but amazing work kulta!
4/21/19, 3:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Huhuh
4/21/19, 3:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Done with another unit
4/21/19, 3:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The next and the final unit will take about 2 hours
4/21/19, 3:39 PM - Shona 😍: Yay! And I finished a third application! I'll go do the cleaning next.
4/21/19, 3:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's it? Only three? I mean are you sure you will be selected for one!
4/21/19, 3:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *?
4/21/19, 3:52 PM - Shona 😍: Well that's what I could manage in this time what I had. Of course I can't be sure I will be selected. Wow, way to bum me out though for the work I put into these ones
4/21/19, 3:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't mean to do that.
4/21/19, 3:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I never made it to any of the positions I applied for.
4/21/19, 3:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I applied for at least 10 of them
4/21/19, 3:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I was just worried
4/21/19, 3:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That if you are serious about working in the summer then how are you going to manage?
4/21/19, 3:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's it
4/21/19, 3:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry for making you feel that way
4/21/19, 3:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was not the slightest of my intentions
4/21/19, 4:32 PM - Shona 😍: You know I've been avoiding this for a long time and I had to kick myself to do this. After completing each application I felt satisfaction for the work I put in, and it felt that what I wrote was better than anything I've written before on job applications. I've just absolutely hated doing it in the past, but this time it wasn't even so bad, I just got to the work. When you said that I felt belittled, like it was worth nothing what I'd just done. Then it made me angry because I knew it was something. And some effort is always better than no effort. Maybe I didn't spend 10 hours on it today and didn't complete 20 applications. 
But I'm gonna be proud of every single minute that I'm being productive and making an effort for a goal or target. Just because there have been so many instances when I've done nothing at all, for a very long time. Wow this became a rant but I was quite upset. And you do have points too and it's good to be reminded that it will increase my chances of getting a job if I fill more applications. But I would appreciate it if it was done without downplaying the effort already made.
4/21/19, 4:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When I was being casual about the applications in this semester, I had two options in mind, A) I may get an internship at the place where I have got one because I knew someone there and B) I would have been fine even if I would not have got one. So, my question to you should have been put like this:
Do you have a backup plan? If yes then what is that? And if not, then what?

I instead asked, are you sure you are going to make it to those three as a point of starting a conversation. 

I really admire your persistence perseverance and diligence. Your new flowing confidence is really helping you get there. And I very much admire that. And I know filling even one application means a lot. I have been there and I totally understand. The fact that you feeling like these are the best applications you have ever written is even better. I so wish that you are able to carry on with the streak. 

I am also insecure about any effort being put in these days because I am myself wary of the output I am garnering for my efforts. As much as I want you to feel good, I am a little hopeless myself because I am stuck and maybe that reflects in my messages. For eg I am studying rn but nothing seems to get in in my head and every minute of studying being put in seems futile so I am sorry if I am giving you that vibe. Partly the reason why I thought why we shouldn't be talking while I have my exams.
4/21/19, 5:24 PM - Shona 😍: I do have a backup plan. I'm 95% sure I can go work with a previous company, the one I used to work with on the market place, if I can find nothing else. Even if that fails, I can spent the beginning of the summer reading books and maybe redoing the superlearner course. 

I'm sorry you feel that way about your own efforts. If today the studying doesn't seem effective, have you thought about what you could do differently? Are you distracted? Are you bored of the topics? Is it something else?
4/21/19, 5:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Knowing your plan now makes me want to appreciate your efforts. Way to go darling. 😗
4/21/19, 5:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is the topics. They are just ugggggh.
4/21/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am also feeling quite hopeless.
4/21/19, 5:26 PM - Shona 😍: Äääh that's the worst... I feel you.
4/21/19, 5:27 PM - Shona 😍: Why?
4/21/19, 5:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A lot of things. But I am studying rn. Can we please talk later?
4/21/19, 5:27 PM - Shona 😍: Yes please I'm cleaning rn :D
4/21/19, 5:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Clean your ass off 😄🤭

4/22/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I am sorry
4/22/19, 12:22 AM - Shona 😍: I can talk for a while
4/22/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We should really take a break
4/22/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is not healthy
4/22/19, 12:22 AM - Shona 😍: I didn't sleep well last night
4/22/19, 12:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am really nervy right now and I am saying things that I am not supposed to
4/22/19, 12:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just told you what you should do and that is something that I shouldn't do.
4/22/19, 12:24 AM - Shona 😍: As I said, I can talk for a while but I will sleep when I'm sleepy. It's not just me being a freak with my schedule but sleep really is important for the studying
4/22/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: And it's less than a month til the exam
4/22/19, 12:26 AM - Shona 😍: Also, you don't get to do that.
4/22/19, 12:26 AM - Shona 😍: I know you're under the  exam pressure

4/22/19, 12:32 AM - Shona 😍: In a constructive way
4/22/19, 12:32 AM - Shona 😍: But I guess it can't always be constructive
4/22/19, 12:33 AM - Shona 😍: Do you want to share something of how you're feeling?
4/22/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am very pissed and I don't want to be rude
4/22/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/22/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe we should talk later then?
4/22/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know what to do or say
4/22/19, 12:36 AM - Shona 😍: Baby. You've had a long day and you've been studying a lot.
4/22/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: You must feel really tired
4/22/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's talk tomorrow.
4/22/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know if I were to speak

4/22/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can sleep peacefully

4/22/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Next time. Don't say thta
4/22/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *that
4/22/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I don't have even that much authority then I don't know how else to feel
4/22/19, 12:44 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe we should have this conversation later. Maybe it has to do with being a woman and being told what to do like that, but it really makes me see red.
4/22/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Great.
4/22/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My hands are already shaking
4/22/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So now is definitely not a good time.
4/22/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: Let's talk tomorrow. Please try to calm down and get some sleep, you need it too. We will not have a fruitful discussion if we're both angry.
4/22/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes

4/22/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Remember
4/22/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Dissent doesn't have to be hurting
4/22/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It can be present

4/22/19, 10:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For not remembering
4/22/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah I wonder
4/22/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: Oh please

4/22/19, 10:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why don't you tell me about your day.
4/22/19, 10:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or or or or.... You can write me a long message. A nice long message about an old memory dear to you.
4/22/19, 10:27 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm

4/22/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok?
4/22/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My sister took the book and finished almost half of it.
4/22/19, 10:31 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaaa

4/22/19, 10:32 PM - Shona 😍: Or for the reading?
4/22/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 1.5 hours. 1 hour 30 mins for reading
4/22/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Done with studying
4/22/19, 10:35 PM - Shona 😍: Alrite
4/22/19, 10:36 PM - Shona 😍: I don't seem to be able to come up with longer good memories. Just very short flashes of some moments

4/22/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I read while we are on video call?
4/22/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will be mostly quiet
4/22/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But at least we will be able to see each other.
4/22/19, 10:38 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds nice
4/22/19, 10:38 PM - Shona 😍: I'll be moving around though
4/22/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's fine. I like seeing you from the side. Am able to appreciate your curves.
4/22/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 👄💋
4/22/19, 10:39 PM - Shona 😍: 😁
4/22/19, 10:39 PM - Shona 😍: But I also meant  out of the room 😅
4/22/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Although nowadays if you look closely at me, I have got curves of my own.
4/22/19, 10:41 PM - Shona 😍: Jaa
4/22/19, 10:41 PM - Shona 😍: That's one thing to say when you don't know what to say

4/22/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad that food has that effect on you
4/22/19, 11:36 PM - Shona 😍: When it's this good it does
4/22/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe also has to do with the fact that we have this only once a year on Easter :D
4/22/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh.
4/22/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: So the scarcity makes it even better
4/22/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Happy Easter shona🥚🥚
4/22/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm

4/22/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/22/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: Also I asked if she's gonna go back to work this week
4/22/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: I thought that's the original plan
4/22/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: But no, she's gonna go in May
4/22/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna pack the lunch for tomorrow
4/22/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: I think I can finish the chapter meanwhile
4/23/19, 12:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Belief was the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior.

“I wouldn’t have said this a year ago—that’s how fast our understanding is changing,” said Tonigan, the University of New Mexico researcher, “but belief seems critical. You don’t have to believe in God, but you do need the capacity to believe that things will get better.


A line that reminded me of you. And in that moment I realized how big a difference you have made in my life. In the last four months even when my life fell apart you were like a rock. A constant amongst all the uncertainty. I could look upto you and I could see a beacon. You were like the far off lighthouse which is the only ray of hope and light that makes the sailor believe in the darkest of the tempests that someone is still out there. That makes the sailor believe that beyond all the wilderness there is afterall a slim chance of survival. You are my lighthouse and you make me believe that everything will be fine. And not just fine it will get better. 
I have dated 23 girls-thats right, that's the number, I finally told you- before you. You know why I left them? Because in none of those 23 relationships I could ever look upto the person. I always lended my shoulder but never got a hand to pulll me out of my rut. 
Seeing you study each day, each day working with grit and passion, be it an application, a petty cleaning job, a    play or punishment. I have not seen you do anything without passion. I have not seen you waver in the loudest of thunders. I have only seen you work and work towards a goal that even if seems insignificant, you make it seem real, you make it sound doable, you make it believable. You make me believe Hanna. You are my belief system. You are my backbone. <3
4/23/19, 12:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't need a god to believe. I have you and I will *```_always_```* have you.
4/23/19, 12:11 AM - Shona 😍: Wow am I speechless rn
4/23/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think you are at loss of words. It's just that too much comes to your mind all at once. I suggest say it all out. I want to know. Send me an audio note. Say it out in Finnish. Nite it down in bullet points first. Take a paper and a pen. 


All this is  if you want to talk. It's perfectly fine if you want to enjoy the silence. Or if sentence you just wrote is an expression of exclamation:p
4/23/19, 12:14 AM - Shona 😍: Exactly, too much comes to my mind at once. I'm crying a bit too.
4/23/19, 12:16 AM - Shona 😍: I will try to find some words
4/23/19, 12:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: :')
4/23/19, 12:59 AM - Shona 😍: Nothing makes me happier than the fact that I’ve helped you to believe. To be able to give you hope. That is something that I want to do more with my life. With you and other people. But you know, you’ve had the same effect on me. Being with you has given me confidence in my own abilities. I still remember us sitting at Rautatientori, and your expression, even though I don’t remember your exact words. But it was that you believed in me that I can do this. It was about the exam. But it’s not only the exam with which you’ve given me confidence. Other areas of my life too. What I want to become and that I want to continue working for my goals. And it’s not because of that one time. It’s because from the very beginning and ever continuing, with your words and actions of encouragement and care you strengthen me. 
Yesterday Laura said to my face that she’s really proud of me. I don’t think she’s ever said that to me. It was after I told how I was doing and how well the practice exams have gone. It felt really good to hear that from her. I’ve always looked up to her and wondered how does she do it all.
I’m slowly starting to believe in myself too. Trying to understand how far I’ve come, and that I don’t need to be the girl anymore who thinks all she’s good for is looking pretty. That girl is gone. And when she tries to whisper something to get me down, I tell her to go to hell and look at the work I’m doing every day and what results I can already see. And that it will only get better from here, this is only the beginning. And I’m not the person anymore, who sat at the med school entrance exam two years ago and couldn’t answer any of the questions. Putting in effort is important and it shows. Sometimes slowly but it does and will show. I finally see it myself too. 
About the last part of your message. Please remember I’m a human too, I have and will stumble like everybody else. But I want to keep helping you believe all my life.
4/23/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: Good night rakkaimpani.
4/23/19, 9:34 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning ☀
4/23/19, 10:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning darling
4/23/19, 10:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok now I am speechless. So much comes to my mind. How do I even express it.
4/23/19, 10:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Made my day already. :')
4/23/19, 10:16 AM - Shona 😍: 😘
4/23/19, 10:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My exact words were, "I believe in you."
The second last paragraph in which you say how you have changed. Babbyyyyyy.  I realize how huge it is for you and I am so happy for you. Although, I am having a told-you-so moment because I have always been saying that you will gain a lot more than knowledge from this exam but let's not count our eggs before they hatch and let's wait for the main exam. I am happy to see the pretty girl go away I mean I am to see you happy and am not saying that you have started to look bad or something. Although you were looking very funny in your wild form yesterday 😁 also, your headbanging was sooooo funny 😁 reminded me of another time when we were in the car and you were trying to dance and it was so fucking funny 😂 but when you dance like that infront of me or do silky things like that, I just realize how far we have come, from being strangers to totally revealing ourselves to each other. As I always say being naked is fine, that's just physical nudity but emotionally it takes a loooong time and I am so glad we are getting there. 
And not just Laura darling. I am proud of you too. And its safe to say that we all are. We always will be. You are one hell of a human.❤
Puccha💋
4/23/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: ❤❤. I really like it when I make you laugh like that, so you'll be seeing silly dancing and headbanging and faces in the future too 😬 I love you Kunji B. All the best for your day ahead. Puccha!
4/23/19, 11:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Puccha tooooo
4/23/19, 11:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/23/19, 12:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Reading done for the day. ✌🏻
4/23/19, 12:23 PM - Shona 😍: :DD 😙😙
4/23/19, 12:23 PM - Shona 😍: 🥳🥳🥳
4/23/19, 12:24 PM - Shona 😍: Awesome! Chapter 5?
4/23/19, 12:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yup
4/23/19, 12:24 PM - Shona 😍: Yaaay
4/23/19, 12:24 PM - Shona 😍: I finished chapter 4 in the morning
4/23/19, 12:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/23/19, 12:25 PM - Shona 😍: Yesyes
4/23/19, 12:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes yes yes
4/23/19, 12:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Keystone habits right?
4/23/19, 12:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What habits according to you are Keystone habits?
4/23/19, 12:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exercising is one for me for sure. Reading is another m
4/23/19, 12:28 PM - Shona 😍: Exercise yeah
4/23/19, 12:28 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe healthy eating too
4/23/19, 12:29 PM - Shona 😍: To me at least
4/23/19, 12:30 PM - Shona 😍: It feels like I'm just getting into reading but seems like it will be one too
4/23/19, 12:35 PM - Shona 😍: And getting up early
4/23/19, 12:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh yes! That!
4/23/19, 12:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you think making your bed is a keystone habit?
4/23/19, 1:04 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm... Somehow that's so automatic to me I don't even think about it. Maybe. Dad was actually very specific about it when we were growing up, making sure that we did it each day
4/23/19, 1:04 PM - Shona 😍: I got a call back from the place where I sent the applications
4/23/19, 1:04 PM - Shona 😍: But the call got cut in the middle because of poor connection 😅
4/23/19, 1:05 PM - Shona 😍: And they tried to call again but it didn't work
4/23/19, 1:05 PM - Shona 😍: They will call again later
4/23/19, 1:05 PM - Shona 😍: I think
4/23/19, 1:15 PM - Shona 😍: Ok so I got an interview there for next Tuesday
4/23/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wow!
4/23/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay!
4/23/19, 1:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What is the work about?
4/23/19, 1:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it the hospital?
4/23/19, 1:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. Same for me. I just do it. But I don't think that it spills over to other habits in my life.
4/23/19, 1:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I still am looking for other keystone habits though
4/23/19, 1:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I guess pursuing a hobby actively like acting or dancing. That's because it _is_  afterall a kind of statement to oneself that my personal life matters too.
4/23/19, 1:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
4/23/19, 1:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Meditation?
4/23/19, 1:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Learning a language?
4/23/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok I am aroused rn and I don't know what to do with myself.
4/23/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Omg. I just felt like meditating! I haven't felt like that in days. The last time I meditated was last to last night because you asked me to. <3
4/23/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I felt like meditating to make the arousal go away.
4/23/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, another chapter done.
4/23/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😗
4/23/19, 2:19 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
4/23/19, 2:24 PM - Shona 😍: True that. And they're constructive activities in a different way than working or studying or reading
4/23/19, 2:27 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm maybe. Though I didn't notice much difference in other areas of my life when I was meditating daily through January and February. But could be that I just didn't consciously notice it, even if it did have a larger impact
4/23/19, 2:30 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe a cold shwer in the morning is. It is uncomfortable, but once done it feels really good, and it teaches that feeling uncomfortable for a while is okay. Maybe that's why this has stuck with me while consistent meditation hasn't. Or could be that the reward is kind of an instant one, the feeling after the shower and that's why I have the motivation to do it
4/23/19, 2:32 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe any type of consistent learning. Though learning another language might introduce new perspectives in a different way
4/23/19, 2:32 PM - Shona 😍: Did it help?
4/23/19, 2:33 PM - Shona 😍: G r e a t  j o b
4/23/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't do it yet
4/23/19, 2:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay!!!!
4/23/19, 3:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/23/19, 3:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is this the book you were reading?
4/23/19, 4:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Another.
4/23/19, 4:32 PM - Shona 😍: Yes!! And the studies conducted by the author at West Point were mentioned in The power of habit too!
4/23/19, 4:32 PM - Shona 😍: Awesome shona awesome
4/23/19, 4:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh I am sorry to tell you
4/23/19, 4:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That
4/23/19, 4:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I finished another 😎
4/23/19, 4:33 PM - Shona 😍: 😁😁😁
4/23/19, 4:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One more and the book finished.
4/23/19, 4:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 50 pages in the book to go.
4/23/19, 4:33 PM - Shona 😍: You're way too much ahead of me :D
4/23/19, 4:33 PM - Shona 😍: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
4/23/19, 4:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a boring read.
4/23/19, 4:33 PM - Shona 😍: It is?
4/23/19, 4:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean there is one line of psychology and 2000 lines of storytelling
4/23/19, 4:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I guess I am getting to hear interesting short stories so maybe it's not that bad and I am just complaining
4/23/19, 4:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, that reminds me, not complaining is another keystone habit
4/23/19, 4:35 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm true
4/23/19, 4:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How has the studying been for you?
4/23/19, 4:36 PM - Shona 😍: Hey seriously I recommend you read that at some point too!
4/23/19, 4:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. I am planning to.
4/23/19, 4:37 PM - Shona 😍: Not the best, I've been slightly distracted by the calls and and then thinking about the summer... And now I'm on my way to get a vaccination :D it's needed if I work in a hospital and I figured I just get it out of the way
4/23/19, 4:37 PM - Shona 😍: Mum's been telling me to get it anyway for months 😅
4/23/19, 4:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes, I heard while I was there in Finland
4/23/19, 4:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So no more studying today?
4/23/19, 4:38 PM - Shona 😍: 😁😅😁

4/23/19, 4:39 PM - Shona 😍: I dunnoo how long does it take at the health care center
4/23/19, 4:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't worry. You will get time. It's just a Tuesday.
4/23/19, 4:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have time in the evenings
4/23/19, 4:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: BTW have you been touching yourself?
4/23/19, 4:40 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
4/23/19, 4:40 PM - Shona 😍: Not every day
4/23/19, 4:40 PM - Shona 😍: But yes
4/23/19, 4:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just asking
4/23/19, 4:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Cos my dick got lonely
4/23/19, 4:41 PM - Shona 😍: I still get very aroused while studying 😅
4/23/19, 4:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *because
4/23/19, 4:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe physics is hot to you too
4/23/19, 4:41 PM - Shona 😍: Oh poor thing
4/23/19, 4:42 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I think bio is hotter
4/23/19, 4:42 PM - Shona 😍: It's actually when my brain starts to get tired
4/23/19, 4:42 PM - Shona 😍: That's when it happens and my mind starts to wander...
4/23/19, 4:44 PM - Shona 😍: In my mind I've been keeping it a lot of company
4/23/19, 4:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tell me about it😗
4/23/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: It's been spending a lot of time in my cunt. Some in my mouth too. I've been rubbing it on my breasts too... And I've been fondling it with my hand
4/23/19, 4:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Words aren't a problem anymore I guess. I am glad to know that 😗
4/23/19, 4:58 PM - Shona 😍: 😗
4/23/19, 5:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh I so want to fuck you.
4/23/19, 5:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Real hard
4/23/19, 5:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In and out
4/23/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/23/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does it ring a bell?
4/23/19, 5:09 PM - Shona 😍: Hahaa yes
4/23/19, 5:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's my next read. It has been long overdue. The story behind the book is really inspiring
4/23/19, 5:10 PM - Shona 😍: Yay!
4/23/19, 5:10 PM - Shona 😍: Mum will be pleased :D
4/23/19, 5:11 PM - Shona 😍: It's been a long time since I read it myself
4/23/19, 5:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Have you read it?

4/23/19, 5:19 PM - Shona 😍: Well this was a useless trip 😂😂😂 they're out of the vaccinations, they said the influenza season is over so no need for it anymore
4/23/19, 5:20 PM - Shona 😍: I wonder what the employer will say
4/23/19, 5:22 PM - Shona 😍: Luckily there's a library downstairs so I can just continue studying here
4/23/19, 5:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay!

4/23/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Still teaching
4/23/19, 10:07 PM - Shona 😍: Ok 🤐
4/23/19, 10:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You want to talk don't you?
4/23/19, 10:16 PM - Shona 😍: I miss you, but I knew you were gonna be busy tonight. I'm planning to go to bed real early and get super good sleep 😁 I still gotta prepare food for tomorrow and eat and then I'll sleep ❤
4/23/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/23/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: At what time is your exam tomorrow?
4/23/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm

4/24/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did you sleep?
4/24/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My exam went very very very welp
4/24/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *well
4/24/19, 11:57 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/24/19, 12:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/24/19, 1:02 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/24/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: I'm starting to think I'd like to re-read the purpose driven life. It would be really nice to discuss it with you and I think I could benefit from it too
4/24/19, 3:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You really love me don't you?
4/24/19, 3:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are starting to feel like doing things with me as well?
4/24/19, 3:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know, how we discusseded Power of Habit together?
4/24/19, 3:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really loved it
4/24/19, 4:19 PM - Shona 😍: Why are you even asking such a question 🙄
4/24/19, 4:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is an element of surprise. Don't take it like a question
4/24/19, 4:25 PM - Shona 😍: Of course. I thought it's not just that I'm starting to feel that but maybe it is. Or maybe it's just that it has felt like there's no suitable activity to do together over the phone. Or I dunno what it is.  Why I had the thought of reading that book again when I saw my Sri Lankan friend's fb post about the terrorist attacks. She's visiting the country atm and she called it a miracle that she wasn't at the place of one of the attacks. She was supposed to be. And then she talked about God and everything and that made me think and...
4/24/19, 4:26 PM - Shona 😍: It's just that I wonder how can you still be surprised about that
4/24/19, 4:26 PM - Shona 😍: I feel a bit lost
4/24/19, 4:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby....
4/24/19, 4:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always wonder whenever I am sitting under a roof that what if the roof falls, sometimes it is more more probable. Sometimes less so.. but it some or the other way crosses my mind. It so happened once that in my school one day one of the cielings of a class on the top floor broke and it cracked but luckily no one got hurt. The fact is that that roof was sound and robust but still something made it crack and then the students were scared but I was not. I just kept wondering that according to that logic everyone is wound up with such dangerous possibilities all the time. Sometimes death is more probable sometimes less. These are pretty pessimistic thoughts but I always embrace them with open arms because I know that life is not just about positivity it is also about embracing the truth and the truth is that sometimes something unfortunate is just one step away. But still we have got to believe that God is watching and he will be just in his judgement to let us live or die. I say all this because one day randomly I was contemplating that what it would feel like if my mother were to pass away and then I realized that it indeed is a very high probability that she might but does that mean that I should just start worrying all the time or feel free that since she is so close to death all the time that I can't do anything about it anyways so chuck it I am not going to care but instead what I do is keep my head down and tread onwards in the journey of life. I just stopped reacting to it.
4/24/19, 4:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it is very unfortunate that your friend had to go through that and it is equally unfortunate that someone had to die in those terror attacks but really much can't be done about such things. Terror is a reality of the modern day world that we live in and according to Bhagvad Gita, it is Karma. Those people will circle back to life and in some other life they _will_ find justice. It just that we won't get to hear about it and that's where faith comes in. So have faith, in God and in life, things will be fine and those people will find their liberation
4/24/19, 4:44 PM - Shona 😍: Those are all good points. I think what it made me wonder was that am I doing anything meaningful in my life. Or how can I make it more meaningful
4/24/19, 4:45 PM - Shona 😍: I don't really believe in reincarnation as such
4/24/19, 4:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was afraid you will say that.
4/24/19, 4:45 PM - Shona 😍: Why afraid?
4/24/19, 4:46 PM - Shona 😍: Do you believe in it yourself?
4/24/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To some extent I find it believable
4/24/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It gives me hope that life is not unjust
4/24/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It may not be true
4/24/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it is a very good lie
4/24/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A very very good one
4/24/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I don't want to live a hopeless life
4/24/19, 4:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know it's a fragile belief system but this is the only one I have got
4/24/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: I think that life is unjust. Death in a way is not
4/24/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: It happens to everyone
4/24/19, 4:49 PM - Shona 😍: But I guess I do believe in some kind of an afterlife. I want to believe
4/24/19, 4:49 PM - Shona 😍: And maybe justice is found then too
4/24/19, 4:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because it is my belief system and in the case you don't agree to it then we have contradictory belief systems which creates a fundamental problem of what will be passed on to our children. I really don't want to be divided on those fronts but I guess we still have time so we can discuss
4/24/19, 4:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Aphewwwww.
4/24/19, 4:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <3
4/24/19, 4:56 PM - Shona 😍: This is something I've been thinking from the beginning. We've kind of been avoiding the topic. Maybe not consciously but we have not talked about it much. I actually thought it is a very fundamental problem, during the time I was still hesitant about whether I want to be with you and whether this can work. I thought it will not be a problem when you said you would be willing to convert to Christianity. That was to me like okay, I don't see why we couldn't do this. But it feels like the lines are blurred when it comes to religion. I'm still figuring out my own perception of it and what exactly do I believe. I guess since quitting my theology studies I have mostly avoided thinking about altogether. It feels like I spent so many years thinking only, or mostly, that
4/24/19, 4:57 PM - Shona 😍: That's kind of the Christian perspective anyway. That God's judgement will be just
4/24/19, 4:58 PM - Shona 😍: But that Jesus has a major role in that justice happening
4/24/19, 4:58 PM - Shona 😍: Yikes this is an intense topic to start in the middle of the day😅
4/24/19, 4:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
4/24/19, 4:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to go study now.
4/24/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: Same here
4/24/19, 4:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's taken this up later

4/25/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: Shona why are you crying?
4/25/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then why didn't you say,
A word for me to stay,
Why did you kneel,
To the __ so reel,
Why did you sway the other way,
Why did you go away?😭
4/25/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In short
4/25/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why didn't you text me!
4/25/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I missed you toooooo
4/25/19, 12:39 AM - Shona 😍: Baby. I was feeling horrible for most of the day. I thought you were studying so I didn't want to disturb 😕
4/25/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 12:42 AM - Shona 😍: 😭😭😭
4/25/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I am sorry
4/25/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't cry
4/25/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am very harsh
4/25/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I shouldn't talk to you like that
4/25/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
4/25/19, 12:43 AM - Shona 😍: It wasn't harsh
4/25/19, 12:43 AM - Shona 😍: And not the first time I cry today
4/25/19, 12:43 AM - Shona 😍: It's just that
4/25/19, 12:44 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know how to do that
4/25/19, 12:44 AM - Shona 😍: I feel very conflicted about it
4/25/19, 12:44 AM - Shona 😍: Somehow I feel that I should be able to pull myself out of it
4/25/19, 12:45 AM - Shona 😍: But at times it's really difficult and I can't seem to do it
4/25/19, 12:45 AM - Shona 😍: But I don't want to disturb you when you're busy. Maybe because that's how I've felt about my studies
4/25/19, 12:45 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know how to do this 😭😭😭
4/25/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry
4/25/19, 12:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't be sorry. Just whenever you want call me
4/25/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Its not like I am studying on a very strict routine. My preferences are subject to yours
4/25/19, 12:52 AM - Shona 😍: Mmmh
4/25/19, 12:55 AM - Shona 😍: Somehow I feel I've chosen a career where it'll be like this all the time. Though when I think about it people say this is the most difficult part. I dunno. Maybe it will get easier. Also the conversation in the afternoon messed me up a bit. I got some old memories and thoughts come back to me
4/25/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: Ugh
4/25/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: Whatever
4/25/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: It was a bad day
4/25/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: Bad couple days actually
4/25/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: But the rest of the week can be better
4/25/19, 12:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can give you a coupon
4/25/19, 12:57 AM - Shona 😍: Also the conversation from Sunday has been playing on my mind
4/25/19, 12:57 AM - Shona 😍: I try not to let it bother
4/25/19, 12:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know which one.
4/25/19, 12:57 AM - Shona 😍: Or pay too much attention
4/25/19, 12:58 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah? The one before and when I sat at the bench outside
4/25/19, 1:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The one about (the-one-whose-name-we-cant-take-too-many-times-for-psychological-too many reasons)?
4/25/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: What now?
4/25/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: The one about your last ex
4/25/19, 1:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/25/19, 1:03 AM - Shona 😍: But I also think it doesn't need to be such a big deal
4/25/19, 1:03 AM - Shona 😍: Whatever the fuck
4/25/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know if there's anything more to add to that conversation rn
4/25/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: I don't feel like using my mental energy on it
4/25/19, 1:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We will talk about it but please don't worry yourself
4/25/19, 1:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think I am sexy to you anymore
4/25/19, 1:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My sex appeal is not clouding you enough
4/25/19, 1:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's why you are thinking about these petty things
4/25/19, 1:05 AM - Shona 😍: Oh God
4/25/19, 1:05 AM - Shona 😍: That's not it
4/25/19, 1:06 AM - Shona 😍: I'm feeling kind of vulnerable about/around the topic
4/25/19, 1:06 AM - Shona 😍: And that's something I wouldn't want to deal with right now
4/25/19, 1:07 AM - Shona 😍: And I think that by paying attention to it I just make it bigger than it would ever need to be
4/25/19, 1:08 AM - Shona 😍: 🙄🙄🙄🙄
4/25/19, 1:08 AM - Shona 😍: I'm just overall frustrated atm
4/25/19, 1:08 AM - Shona 😍: I was getting a bit scared of the exam again
4/25/19, 1:09 AM - Shona 😍: I'm doing revision and it's super boring
4/25/19, 1:09 AM - Shona 😍: So my mind drifts
4/25/19, 1:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Motivation is also like a reservoir darling
4/25/19, 1:09 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know how to keep it interesting and my mind engaged
4/25/19, 1:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It gets depleted
4/25/19, 1:10 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah..
4/25/19, 1:12 AM - Shona 😍: 😐
4/25/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Once you give this exam
4/25/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Get over this period (pun intended)
4/25/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will be all fine and happy
4/25/19, 1:14 AM - Shona 😍: Hahha
4/25/19, 1:14 AM - Shona 😍: True
4/25/19, 1:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ever watched an angry nasty news debate?
4/25/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: I'm getting more anxious as it approaches, but I can't give it yet
4/25/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: Ummm
4/25/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe?
4/25/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: Why?
4/25/19, 1:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's how ordered your hormonal state is right now
4/25/19, 1:16 AM - Shona 😍: Mmmh
4/25/19, 1:16 AM - Shona 😍: I thought about that today too
4/25/19, 1:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤
4/25/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: That it might be because of the coming period too
4/25/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So now I am having your thoughts?❤
4/25/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: Perhaps
4/25/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: 💩💩💩💩💩
4/25/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: That's just an overall feeling
4/25/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: Not about what you just said
4/25/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: Truck load of crap
4/25/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: And you're not even teleporting through it
4/25/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: :/
4/25/19, 1:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 1:19 AM - Shona 😍: 😬🙄🤭🤥🥴
4/25/19, 1:19 AM - Shona 😍: 💩
4/25/19, 1:20 AM - Shona 😍: May I sleep shona?
4/25/19, 1:20 AM - Shona 😍: I really don't want to
4/25/19, 1:20 AM - Shona 😍: But I have a feeling tomorrow will be crap too if I don't
4/25/19, 1:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 1:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Life is not that rational
4/25/19, 1:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have slept for hours in days and been depressed
4/25/19, 1:21 AM - Shona 😍: I've understood it's adviced to rest well with these... hormone baths that are happening
4/25/19, 1:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I have slept four hours a day and still give my best
4/25/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah I know
4/25/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: But all hell will be loose if I only sleep four and I need to study
4/25/19, 1:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a very very nice idea for you
4/25/19, 1:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it will take a few precious minutes of your time
4/25/19, 1:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Close your eyes for five minutes
4/25/19, 1:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And think about how much you are fluctuating
4/25/19, 1:23 AM - Shona 😍: I will sleep if I do that
4/25/19, 1:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As a blob of thoughts and emotions
4/25/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How much you are Changing
4/25/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Each second
4/25/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Going where the mind goes
4/25/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Down the memory lane
4/25/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Making you happy sad angry or whatever
4/25/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Think deep
4/25/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will really enjoy it
4/25/19, 1:25 AM - Shona 😍: 💩💩💩
4/25/19, 1:25 AM - Shona 😍: 💩

4/25/19, 1:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
4/25/19, 1:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Have you ever thought of getting your nose pierced?
4/25/19, 2:04 PM - Shona 😍: She's cute! Who is she?
4/25/19, 2:04 PM - Shona 😍: I have actually 🤔
4/25/19, 2:09 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 3:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I meant
4/25/19, 3:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can call me if you want
4/25/19, 3:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am yours and I can give up stuff to talk to you
4/25/19, 3:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wanted to tell you something important
4/25/19, 3:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I come from a culture where I have witnessed my grandmother and grandfather live apart for the time as far as I can remember. I just had this memory yesterday that when I was a child my grandmother used to live in a different room than my grandfather. He used to live in a room outside the house and he never spoke to her directly and everyone played along. Everyone behaved like it was normal. That means everyone behaved like it was fine for a married couple to not talk to each other at all and still be in that relationship and still not talk to each other for years. Everyone was just happy to pass messages along and they were more than happy to comply with such behavior. And that is the culture I have grown up with in which crappy marriages are fine. People will tolerate everything to be in a marriage for the sake of the world and what the world would say.
4/25/19, 3:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you. I really do.
4/25/19, 3:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am in my room rn
4/25/19, 3:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Naked
4/25/19, 3:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish you were here.
4/25/19, 3:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To lie next to me
4/25/19, 3:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that I could touch you there
4/25/19, 3:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With my dick
4/25/19, 3:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What are we doing so far apart
4/25/19, 3:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙁
4/25/19, 4:14 PM - Shona 😍: To me that sounds very sad. But our grandparents are also of a different generation. Even in my parents' relationship there are aspects I would never want for myself. I know less about how it was with my grandparents but there are vibes from what I can guess some things and some stuff I've heard. But from outside I can't really know what it is or has been like. That sounds like a very extreme arrangement that your grandparents had. I don't know if it would've been better for them to just separate completely or what since I don't know enough about it. What we can do for ourselves is to think what we want and then create it.
4/25/19, 4:15 PM - Shona 😍: I wish I was there with you too
4/25/19, 4:15 PM - Shona 😍: July will be here soon ❤
4/25/19, 4:16 PM - Shona 😍: But I very well know the feeling

4/25/19, 6:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ??
4/25/19, 6:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: OMG

4/25/19, 6:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *you

4/25/19, 6:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are everything I have ever wanted.
4/25/19, 6:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a very interesting thing I have to tell you from my childhood
4/25/19, 6:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Aren't you done for the day?

4/25/19, 6:56 PM - Shona 😍: You shouldn't give me ideas in the middle of the day
4/25/19, 6:57 PM - Shona 😍: During the last hour I spent way too much time thinking about naked you
4/25/19, 6:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's good.
4/25/19, 6:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometimes you should enjoy life.
4/25/19, 6:58 PM - Shona 😍: 😁
4/25/19, 6:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Take it lightly
4/25/19, 6:58 PM - Shona 😍: But not when I'm studying chemistry!
4/25/19, 6:59 PM - Shona 😍: Sometimes I wonder though
4/25/19, 6:59 PM - Shona 😍: What it would be like to have sex _while_ studying :D
4/25/19, 7:00 PM - Shona 😍: And this is not a new idea
4/25/19, 7:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oooo
4/25/19, 7:00 PM - Shona 😍: I've thought about it years ago 😂
4/25/19, 7:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are getting there
4/25/19, 7:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
4/25/19, 7:00 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I've just always been getting aroused while studying
4/25/19, 7:00 PM - Shona 😍: 😚
4/25/19, 7:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are just... ❤
4/25/19, 7:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are perfect
4/25/19, 7:01 PM - Shona 😍: And I never thought I would say that to someone :D
4/25/19, 7:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well you hadn't met me at the time.
4/25/19, 7:09 PM - Shona 😍: I know
4/25/19, 7:10 PM - Shona 😍: Or maybe more accurately, I also never thought I would get that kind of reaction when telling that
4/25/19, 7:38 PM - Shona 😍: This message was deleted
4/25/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry for the censorship 😬
4/25/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: I thought maybe better that I think about it first on my own
4/25/19, 8:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭👄
4/25/19, 8:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please say
4/25/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: BABY
4/25/19, 8:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes Shona
4/25/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: I want to pull your cheeks and kiss them
4/25/19, 8:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭
4/25/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: I want to kiss you between your eyebrows
4/25/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: I want to bite your lips and feel your teeth with my tongue
4/25/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 💋
4/25/19, 8:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always feel that's a very sacred place to kiss someone
4/25/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: :D
4/25/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: Ohhhh
4/25/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: I read scary 😂
4/25/19, 8:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
4/25/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: I was thinking why scary
4/25/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm why sacred then
4/25/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it is. I mean what if someone whispers some ghost in your mind 👻
4/25/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: 🙀
4/25/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't believe in ghosts.
4/25/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But something about that scares me now 😨
4/25/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: No don't think about it 😳
4/25/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: It's a scary idea
4/25/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: No it's not
4/25/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: Me neither
4/25/19, 8:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I ordered the book

4/25/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not there yet 😅
4/25/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: But I'm getting curious
4/25/19, 8:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I almost cried while reading the chapter
4/25/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: 😳😳
4/25/19, 8:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is a very relatable and a very moving chapter
4/25/19, 8:44 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm should I just skip 7 and 8 😬
4/25/19, 8:44 PM - Shona 😍: You were right there's a looooot of storytelling too
4/25/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 8 yes.
4/25/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't skip 7. 7 is nice.
4/25/19, 8:45 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmhmm
4/25/19, 8:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 8 made me want to drop the book
4/25/19, 8:46 PM - Shona 😍: Was it that bad? 😅
4/25/19, 8:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh no
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: Why?
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean no
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It wasn't that bad
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the storytelling was too much
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe I just don't like those stories
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About the civil Rights Movement
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: Oh?
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It had important points
4/25/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
4/25/19, 8:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But this is also true.
4/25/19, 8:48 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm okay
4/25/19, 8:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are your days full of thoughts about July too?
4/25/19, 8:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was feeling very sad in the day about the state of our relationship rn
4/25/19, 8:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The pain and the wait is almost unbearable now.
4/25/19, 8:50 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah and about you! I mean maybe it's not specifically about July. But just you and being with you, actually physically present
4/25/19, 8:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: . Can you please tell me?
4/25/19, 8:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. I can understand
4/25/19, 8:50 PM - Shona 😍: It is getting more difficult
4/25/19, 8:51 PM - Shona 😍: But somehow it also seems like I feel deeper and deeper
4/25/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just feel like I just want to sit you down and just sit on your lap and keep talking to you
4/25/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am also feeling how strong my emotions are.
4/25/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They just want me to be with someone across 7 oceans
4/25/19, 8:52 PM - Shona 😍: Nah that was boring. I'll get back to it when there's something more to it
4/25/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And they won't settle without her
4/25/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please?
4/25/19, 8:53 PM - Shona 😍: ❤.
4/25/19, 8:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On and on and on
4/25/19, 8:54 PM - Shona 😍: It was about phone sex and I was like okay this doesn't bring much anything new to the conversation so no use
4/25/19, 8:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't do that. I mean the deletion. It's not like I make sense all the time whenever I speak. So please if you are going to say stuff then let it remain so that we can really have an uncensored conversation
4/25/19, 8:56 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe you're right
4/25/19, 8:57 PM - Shona 😍: Butbut
4/25/19, 8:57 PM - Shona 😍: But
4/25/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 9:00 PM - Shona 😍: It was just that I feel like initiating at times when I feel aroused but then I think I'd like to come and that's more difficult (or not happening yet) during phone sex so I don't know what to do. And most times I've just then ended up doing it on my own. But I also really like seeing you. And then I thought masturbating alone is also a bit boring at times.
4/25/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: Uuuh
4/25/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: 45°¡¡¿¿¿!!??
4/25/19, 9:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
4/25/19, 9:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was one _hell_ of a day
4/25/19, 9:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was unbearable
4/25/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Literally unbearable
4/25/19, 9:02 PM - Shona 😍: Oh god
4/25/19, 9:02 PM - Shona 😍: What did you do?
4/25/19, 9:02 PM - Shona 😍: Were you outside or indoors or what do you do when it's that hot?
4/25/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just felt restless
4/25/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both
4/25/19, 9:03 PM - Shona 😍: Yäääääääääk
4/25/19, 9:03 PM - Shona 😍: 😕
4/25/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At times there will be a day when you will have to touch yourself
4/25/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At times you will have to have sex with me and I will cum and you will not and even in that case you will have to touch yourself
4/25/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At times you will come before me and I will be so tired of the humping that I will have to give up
4/25/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is only in movies in which everyone comes together everytime
4/25/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My point to you is. mix it up. Stop perfecting it. Stop feeling that it will change for the better and everything will be fine.
4/25/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You want to see me? Then see me and then if you can't come then finish yourself by yourself. If you can come with me then come with me. If you feel like tantalizing both yourself and me then have a conversation like the kind you want to have. If in the middle you feel it's boring then let it be  and leave it.
4/25/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My point is. Dont overthink it
4/25/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: Yes. Good point.
4/25/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you were saying about phones sex?
4/25/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/25/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: :D
4/25/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: Well that was earlier
4/25/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like a peeled potato
4/25/19, 9:10 PM - Shona 😍: Why??? And what does that feel like?
4/25/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like I have revealed myself completely to you and there is nothing more to tell 😂
4/25/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: 😃
4/25/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I feel peeled or exposed
4/25/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: I thought maybe it had to do with the hot weather 😂
4/25/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: But I see

4/25/19, 9:28 PM - Shona 😍: Also, I've always found the upper back a very attractive body part
4/25/19, 9:29 PM - Shona 😍: I mean especially when you can see the muscles underneath it's like the most attractive part ever
4/25/19, 9:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No.

4/25/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd I was at your service
4/25/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What would you have asked me to do for you
4/25/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: Well that depends what I would be feeling at the moment
4/25/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: And good rulers shouldn't exploit their subjects
4/25/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: But when sitting at my throne
4/25/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: I would want you to pick me up
4/25/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: And carry me to my chambers

4/25/19, 10:01 PM - Shona 😍: Then start tearing off my clothes
4/25/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😍
4/25/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am going home.
4/25/19, 10:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 10:32 PM - Shona 😍: Oh?
4/25/19, 10:35 PM - Shona 😍: Well. I really like the long conversations on video call. And when you write to me. But the video calls are the closest to actually having you here I guess
4/25/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to say to that. I have everything here except for you
4/25/19, 10:39 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm something you can do is share some good recipes :D I could use some inspiration
4/25/19, 10:43 PM - Shona 😍: But that's so sweet of you to ask
4/25/19, 10:43 PM - Shona 😍: I'm just not used to asking people to do things for me
4/25/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/25/19, 10:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well get used to it my princess
4/25/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: Don't you have the exam?
4/25/19, 11:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At 4pm
4/25/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
4/25/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/25/19, 11:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will go back
4/25/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: How do you feel about it?
4/25/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: The exam
4/25/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very very chillaxed
4/25/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Awesome 😍
4/25/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Is that the last one? Or something left?
4/25/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 2 after that
4/25/19, 11:16 PM - Shona 😍: Oh 😅😅 why did I think it ends this week... Hmm maybe I thought it will be only one week and no exams on weekends like here
4/25/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: When are those?
4/25/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Last is on 30
4/25/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I will be after Friday
4/25/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: Be what?
4/25/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Free
4/25/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
4/25/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
4/25/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry we can't talk on video call
4/25/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😭
4/25/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not crying
4/25/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just bummed.
4/25/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is sad.
4/25/19, 11:19 PM - Shona 😍: Me too :(
4/25/19, 11:19 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
4/25/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it also a big fundamental problem
4/25/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I get started in my day late
4/25/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I am the most productive only after a while I mean generally in the evenings and at night
4/25/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it's not like I can't study in the day and talk to you in the night
4/25/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's just that I only am able to finish studying until very late
4/25/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd then it is just studying on my mind
4/25/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah that is an issue 🤔
4/25/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like if I will talk to you then I will feel I could have utilizes that time and then I will feel guilty during the exam and that will create a negative feedback ever increasing loop
4/25/19, 11:22 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah that's awful...
4/25/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's also because in the past I have fucked up my exams because of my relationships
4/25/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I don't want that to even strike my mind in these exams
4/25/19, 11:22 PM - Shona 😍: Don't do it this time.
4/25/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I so want our relationship to be out of that label.
4/25/19, 11:22 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
4/25/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I am just in a very comfortable zone with the whole exam situation rn
4/25/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I dont want it to change.
4/25/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: Let's not change that then :)
4/25/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: But do you think this will be the problem in the future too?
4/25/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not so much
4/25/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The thing is that rn I have people whom I have to teach
4/25/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And they are nocturnals
4/25/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really feel like teaching them because you know how much I retain after teaching
4/25/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And so my schedule automatically shifts at night to match theirs
4/25/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But in general in the future since all my friends will graduate, I will be on my own and most probably will finish most of my studying in the day and hence it won't be a problem
4/25/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
4/25/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: I see
4/25/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: If you think so
4/25/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You seem skeptical of the idea
4/25/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: Well you know yourself better in this regard
4/25/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: I tried to remember how was it when you were here
4/25/19, 11:38 PM - Shona 😍: I think you did both
4/25/19, 11:38 PM - Shona 😍: Studied with me earlier
4/25/19, 11:38 PM - Shona 😍: But also quite late in the night
4/25/19, 11:38 PM - Shona 😍: For example on the cruise
4/25/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I guess then it will always be like that. At least that's what the data says.
4/25/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a habit of delaying things to the last
4/25/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So. .
4/25/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/25/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: Well if that's how you like to do it then that's it
4/25/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: Or maybe you'd benefit from reading The perfect day formula :D
4/25/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: I'm just picturing scenarios now where you can't participate in family stuff because of that
4/25/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: Dates with me
4/25/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: But maybe that's way too early to think such things 😂
4/25/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 👶🏻
4/25/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please tell me something about yourself that I don't know.
4/25/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/25/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: When I was younger I wanted to be a master mariner
4/25/19, 11:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What's that?
4/25/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I don't have my exams all the time Shona. 🤭
4/25/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am able to complete most of my work in the day if I want
4/25/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: A sea(wo)man who can be the captain of a ship
4/25/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/25/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: True
4/25/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmhmm
4/25/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did I tell you I gave an exam for Merchant Navy?
4/25/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: Oh and that was in secondary school
4/25/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: I actually considered it
4/25/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Which I passed with flying colors BTW.
4/25/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: Looked up the education programs
4/25/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: No?
4/25/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh!
4/25/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. If not for my mother's lack of funds, I would have been off to a ship rn
4/25/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: Merchant Navy?
4/25/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: I mean what would you have been doing there?
4/25/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Merchant navy https://g.co/kgs/DAZNdR
4/25/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 11:52 PM - Shona 😍: Do you still grieve about the missed opportunity?
4/25/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I would have started as a cadet
4/25/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then slowly
4/25/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A captain myself
4/25/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wanted to be a captain of the Royal Caribbean
4/25/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: :D
4/25/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: Coool
4/25/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So... Is this a coincidence?
4/25/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: It's quite funny
4/25/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How so?
4/25/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: I just find it funny
4/25/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: That we thought about the same thing
4/25/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: Earlier in our lives
4/25/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I came home for the AC. And now the electricity supply got cut. So it's the heat again. 😡
4/25/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: Both wanted to sail off to somewhere
4/25/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: Oh noooooo😱😱😱😱
4/25/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: I thought that might be the reason 😅 that you're going because of the AC
4/25/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
4/25/19, 11:56 PM - Shona 😍: How long do you think it will last?
4/25/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just as a comparison for you.
4/25/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know.
4/25/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It can come any moment
4/25/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or it can never come
4/25/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can't really say
4/25/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: 😳
4/25/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The one AC that you have near the piano which is open all the time?
4/25/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is the only AC we have got in one room
4/25/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's all the AC we have
4/25/19, 11:58 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
4/25/19, 11:58 PM - Shona 😍: Oh God
4/25/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Our houses are not centrally Air conditioned.
4/25/19, 11:58 PM - Shona 😍: 😱🥵
4/25/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I keep telling you all this stuff because I want you to understand where I come from
4/25/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how big is the difference
4/25/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe then you will understand how huge this- our relationship-is
4/25/19, 11:59 PM - Shona 😍: I really like it when you do tell
4/26/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: And I want to come there and experience it myself
4/26/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All my life I have wished for that to happen in all my relationships. Comes with a part of the N in ENTp and INFJ. But now in this relationship I was being practical and never really gave much thought to these things but look what is happening
4/26/19, 12:01 AM - Shona 😍: :)
4/26/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How long before you sleep?
4/26/19, 12:02 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/26/19, 12:02 AM - Shona 😍: I'm eating atm
4/26/19, 12:02 AM - Shona 😍: Was planning to sleep soon after this
4/26/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I wanted to tell you about this
4/26/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a long topic
4/26/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to say you should delay sleeping
4/26/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that's not my call to make
4/26/19, 12:11 AM - Shona 😍: This indeed is a recurring problem 😅 you want to _start_ long conversations when I'm planning to sleep
4/26/19, 12:12 AM - Shona 😍: And I'm gonna have to get up at 6.20 no matter what
4/26/19, 12:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok fine
4/26/19, 12:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry
4/26/19, 12:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not say
4/26/19, 12:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ✌🏻
4/26/19, 12:12 AM - Shona 😍: Somehow I thought it wouldn't be like this since you're two and half hours ahead of me 😂
4/26/19, 12:13 AM - Shona 😍: I can talk a bit longer
4/26/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No you don't have to
4/26/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can go
4/26/19, 12:13 AM - Shona 😍: But it's not wise to start hours long conversations
4/26/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Life is not all about wise decisions
4/26/19, 12:13 AM - Shona 😍: It is not.
4/26/19, 12:14 AM - Shona 😍: But I will have my exam in less than a month.
4/26/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are right
4/26/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Anywayd
4/26/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *anyways
4/26/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: You say you don't want to fuck up your exams anymore because of a relationship
4/26/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: And that's wise imo
4/26/19, 12:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What I want to say is indeed very long and I am very handicapped in terms of words
4/26/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: I don't want to do it either
4/26/19, 12:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So let's do that some other time.
4/26/19, 12:16 AM - Shona 😍: Let's. We will find the time :)
4/26/19, 12:17 AM - Shona 😍: As much as I would love to talk with you. It was very special when we talked late in the small hours when I was home alone
4/26/19, 12:18 AM - Shona 😍: Good God it's less than 3 weeks!
4/26/19, 12:18 AM - Shona 😍: Now I feel like freaking out a bit
4/26/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you are doing something very very wrong
4/26/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mom just slapped me
4/26/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
4/26/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't mind me saying
4/26/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's no way to console someone
4/26/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I think you are telling yourself that you _should_ be freaking out because it's only three weeks left
4/26/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because honestly imo
4/26/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have never seen anyone more prepared
4/26/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: :D
4/26/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can give the exam tomorrow
4/26/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: 😳😳😳😳😳
4/26/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you will pass it with flying colors
4/26/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you don't have _any reason whatsoever_ to freak out
4/26/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't get me wrong
4/26/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not rationalizing your emotions
4/26/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But ask yourself
4/26/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why are you freaking out?
4/26/19, 12:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because generally it is so that people are underprepared and that makes them freak out but in your case you are over prepared
4/26/19, 12:27 AM - Shona 😍: Because I could still know the contents better.. And I'm just thinking if others will know it better
4/26/19, 12:28 AM - Shona 😍: I mean there are more things in the syllabi
4/26/19, 12:28 AM - Shona 😍: But yeah I'm pretty darn well prepared with the majority of the topics
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is a thing with such exams
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That no matter what you do
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will never be enough
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe my morale just took a hit because the beginning of the week was quite crappy
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Some topic will always be left
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I tell you something
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Shona 😍: Please
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And listen to me carefully
4/26/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is one of the things that I really believe in
4/26/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There are two ways of reaching your goal
4/26/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One is the Messi way
4/26/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd one is the Ronaldo way
4/26/19, 12:30 AM - Shona 😍: I don't watch football 😬
4/26/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Messi is an Argentinian footballer who is just a magical magical player because of all the talents he had
4/26/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *has
4/26/19, 12:31 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/26/19, 12:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And Ronaldo is a Portuguese footballer who is a very hard working athlete and is not as talented as Messi
4/26/19, 12:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But has still won more awards than messi
4/26/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't be mistaken Messi practices as well and is also an excellent player
4/26/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But time and agian Ronaldo has beaten him in winning trophies for the best player with his sheer efforts
4/26/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Coming back to the topic
4/26/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In the exam you are appearing or any such competitive exam
4/26/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There are two kinds of people
4/26/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One who are extremely talented
4/26/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And one who are extremely ardent
4/26/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are of the second kind.
4/26/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: People of the first kind may still win but they will be far less and they will only win when they have worked hard if not more then as much as you did
4/26/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And on top of it
4/26/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am a very strong believer of the fact that honest efforts are always rewarded
4/26/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you _will_ and that I say with absolute certainty that you _will_ get in.
4/26/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I _believe_ in you
4/26/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: _yyou_
4/26/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And only you
4/26/19, 12:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Electricity is back BTW. And I am enjoying the AC. Finally.
4/26/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: Baby
4/26/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: Yay! ❤
4/26/19, 12:38 AM - Shona 😍: Thanks for the encouragement. I need it.
4/26/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not encouragement
4/26/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's the truth
4/26/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Encouragement can be made up
4/26/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But this is not
4/26/19, 12:39 AM - Shona 😍: And especially after reading Grit I do believe in hard work over talent
4/26/19, 12:40 AM - Shona 😍: Well then the truth is encouraging? I don't know what to feel about it then
4/26/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well when I really want something to happen. I just stop thinking about the results
4/26/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I work hard on it
4/26/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Give it my best
4/26/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Enjoy the challenge
4/26/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And absolutely stay away from the results
4/26/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't even check my results
4/26/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am so averse of it
4/26/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Other people check it and tell me.
4/26/19, 12:42 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/26/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You told me one day
4/26/19, 12:42 AM - Shona 😍: That's a good approach I guess
4/26/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you really like studying
4/26/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if I know you
4/26/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You must have really liked studying for you to say that
4/26/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: By far you have enjoyed your studying
4/26/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I can tell you from experience
4/26/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That this is the last time you are enjoying studying
4/26/19, 12:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a rarity that after the exam you will enjoy studying as much
4/26/19, 12:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because in College subjects change quickly and there's hardly anytime for you to explore things
4/26/19, 12:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you will have to do it on your own and almost always in a rush.
4/26/19, 12:45 AM - Shona 😍: Umm I think it's the opposite? Because then I get to study what I'm genuinely interested in
4/26/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So enjoy the days left
4/26/19, 12:45 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/26/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not a given.
4/26/19, 12:45 AM - Shona 😍: Well the rush is not good
4/26/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't see them as 21 days left in the exam.
4/26/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See them as the last 21 days of the best studying you will ever get to do.
4/26/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not kidding Shona.
4/26/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mark my words s
4/26/19, 12:46 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm. Well we'll see about that.
4/26/19, 12:46 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe so
4/26/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: It is quite easy stuff after all
4/26/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: What I'm studying atm
4/26/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's it.
4/26/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Right there
4/26/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the problem
4/26/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You think it's easy.
4/26/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not.
4/26/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If it was easy you would have done it two years ago.
4/26/19, 12:49 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm true
4/26/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: _You_ have made it easy
4/26/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is why I am confident
4/26/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I am more confident about you than you yourself
4/26/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/26/19, 12:50 AM - Shona 😍: I think you might be :)
4/26/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As I have always said
4/26/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I _believe_ in you.
4/26/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: _you_
4/26/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And only _you_
4/26/19, 12:51 AM - Shona 😍: That's very sweet and special to me. But I hope I will find the confidence in myself too.
4/26/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But now I am wondering do you have to?
4/26/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean do you think you need "confidence" to get up and go the library each day to study?
4/26/19, 12:52 AM - Shona 😍: No..
4/26/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's it!
4/26/19, 12:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't treat the exam as a big event
4/26/19, 12:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's just a bunch of any other questions
4/26/19, 12:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you need confidence to solve them?
4/26/19, 12:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You just need to solve them I guess
4/26/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: No...
4/26/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: :)
4/26/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: Shona
4/26/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: I love you

4/26/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Believe me, the dick sizes I saw in Flamingo, you _could_ have found one.😂

4/26/19, 12:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: After a point I looked at mine and I was like "grow up you Morron"🤭
4/26/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: ...

4/26/19, 9:05 PM - Shona 😍: Shona sports bra is not supposed to be saucy but provide some support 😂

4/27/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And we are dancing to our own tunes.
4/27/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I think it's completely fine to bang you while you work
4/27/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's kind of like the studying one. 🤭

4/27/19, 11:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Message two people.
4/27/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: First one replied with a taunting answer.
4/27/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He always does that
4/27/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I told him that you don't have to do that everytime
4/27/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I don't think I can stand that anymore.
4/27/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I said so.
4/27/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He asked me to peace out
4/27/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am planning to avoid that person totallly
4/27/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The other person I messaged was Shubhangi. The girl went to meet in Lucknow (the 100 KMS city like Helsinki to Turku)
4/27/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I messaged her
4/27/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wassup and she said something totally cold and then she said whatsup with you
4/27/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is what she always does. Just keeps asking me what is up with me
4/27/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like I am a clown for her and my job is to entertain her with new content
4/27/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I said nothing much. (I didn't react?
4/27/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *)
4/27/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then she said life is dull
4/27/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I said she should date someone
4/27/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She said can't find anyone
4/27/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I just said that
4/27/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a pointless conversation
4/27/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So good night
4/27/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because it was a pointless conversation
4/27/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We have already been over that topic a thousand times by now
4/27/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So she said that I am rude
4/27/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I said that I didn't mean to be rude.
4/27/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So she said that she can't keep forgive me as I am always Moody and rude
4/27/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I got very very very mad
4/27/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd I told her that I was not saying sorry and was not seeking her forgiveness because it's not an obligation but a friend's duty to stand through in thick and thin and these are in part largely my mood swings so there is nothing to apologies for
4/27/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Anyways but then I realized that she is not going to yield
4/27/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ever
4/27/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And nor am I gonna
4/27/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I said good bye
4/27/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd left
4/27/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: Ohhoh
4/27/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: So which one do you not want to be in touch anymore?
4/27/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both of em
4/27/19, 11:44 PM - Shona 😍: That I don't quite understand
4/27/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: Like what exactly do you not like about it? Do you think she wasn't genuinely interested in what's going on with you? Just wanted entertainment? I'm asking because when I ask people that I do want to know
4/27/19, 11:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Entertainment mostly
4/27/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She is not interested in my life or my problems
4/27/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And its so irritating to tell her about them anyways
4/27/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She thinks she is senior to me in some years
4/27/19, 11:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So she has seen the world
4/27/19, 11:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She thinks she knows it all
4/27/19, 11:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd I know nothing
4/27/19, 11:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it is so irritating to see someone constantly compromise in their lives and then preach like they know it all
4/27/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Compromise in life
4/27/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd know all about life
4/27/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/27/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She actually says this. You are a kid. You don't know this. You don't know that. You don't know what's life. You don't know a shit about this etc etc
4/27/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Leave it. What the fuck do I care!n
4/27/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fuck it
4/27/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: Well that doesn't sound very nice
4/27/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fuuuuuuuuck!
4/27/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😤😡😡😡🤬
4/27/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: 🙁
4/27/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know the most perilous thing about my anger right now.
4/27/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It makes me want to be destructive
4/27/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I want to live with that emotion
4/27/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wow!
4/27/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't know what to say either?n
4/27/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Really?
4/27/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: I'm wondering what would you want
4/27/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: Me to listen to you
4/27/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: Or give some opinions
4/27/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen.
4/27/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Dont
4/27/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Spare yourself.
4/27/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's talk tomorrow. ✌🏻
4/27/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bye.
4/27/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night.
4/27/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: Shonaaaaaa
4/27/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Say
4/27/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: I can listen
4/27/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So can a wall.
4/27/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: Okay, if you don't want me to listen that's fine
4/27/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What is that supposed to mean?
4/27/19, 11:56 PM - Shona 😍: Well I'm not quite following
4/27/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: At least to me it's helpful sometimes when someone just listens
4/27/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: At times advice is nice
4/27/19, 11:58 PM - Shona 😍: So I'm wondering what do you wish for
4/27/19, 11:59 PM - Shona 😍: Is there something I can do to make you feel better?
4/28/19, 12:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish to ask you a question. If you were feeling angry. How would you like if the same questions were asked to you. Do you think when a person is angry they can study themselves objectively and tell you what they want? Because, if they knew what they wanted wouldn't they have done it by now? When was the last time you were angry/sad/demotivated and I was asking you which strategy will be better?
4/28/19, 12:03 AM - Shona 😍: Well that's exactly what you've done? Asked if I want you to listen or find solutions
4/28/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Great! Then I guess I suck at it-consoling someone.
4/28/19, 12:05 AM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's a bad thing to ask
4/28/19, 12:05 AM - Shona 😍: I can't read your mind, you can't read mine
4/28/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What do you want me to say
4/28/19, 12:22 AM - Shona 😍: Nothing? I mean you can but I'm not expecting you to say
4/28/19, 12:22 AM - Shona 😍: You feel angry
4/28/19, 12:22 AM - Shona 😍: That's fine
4/28/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not angry anymore
4/28/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A bit annoyed maybe
4/28/19, 12:22 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/28/19, 12:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry for tampering your mood
4/28/19, 12:24 AM - Shona 😍: The conversation reminded me of something I read in come as you are, about dealing with emotions
4/28/19, 12:24 AM - Shona 😍: I can share it later
4/28/19, 12:24 AM - Shona 😍: I feel quite neutral rn
4/28/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good.
4/28/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was your day
4/28/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: Loooooong
4/28/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you are busy we can talk later.
4/28/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you want to sleep we can talk later
4/28/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: Very good overall
4/28/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you don't want to talk we can talk later
4/28/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: I'm not gonna sleep yet
4/28/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: I gotta take Nelli out soon
4/28/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: We just got home
4/28/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you are busy
4/28/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not in the mood for an on/off conversation.
4/28/19, 12:26 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm I get it
4/28/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Either you in or out
4/28/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can choose
4/28/19, 12:26 AM - Shona 😍: Though I could send audio notes
4/28/19, 12:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why bother. 😊
4/28/19, 12:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night. 😊✌🏻
4/28/19, 12:27 AM - Shona 😍: Want to talk on videocall?
4/28/19, 12:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't.
4/28/19, 12:27 AM - Shona 😍: Okay

4/28/19, 12:33 AM - Shona 😍: But your internet seems to be slow again

4/28/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: Okay I just went out with Nelli
4/28/19, 12:38 AM - Shona 😍: We are not gonna be for long
4/28/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go do all your stuff
4/28/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Night time routine etc etc
4/28/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When you are done text me
4/28/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you don't feel like texting and are very tired feel free to sleep. I understand that you have Had a long day.
4/28/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just text me whatever the case
4/28/19, 12:39 AM - Shona 😍: Okay then
4/28/19, 1:00 AM - Shona 😍: Kultaseni
4/28/19, 1:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/28/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: Seeing my cousins with their partners today was very adorable
4/28/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: They seem so great together
4/28/19, 1:03 AM - Shona 😍: I really like my relatives
4/28/19, 1:03 AM - Shona 😍: From my mother's side
4/28/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe because we've spent so much time together in the past
4/28/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: Now we see more rarely
4/28/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: But it's still a blast
4/28/19, 1:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That reminds me.
4/28/19, 1:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you should join some form of community
4/28/19, 1:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it's time that you should go back to church or the Sunday service.
4/28/19, 1:06 AM - Shona 😍: Today I was reminded how much fun it can be around people
4/28/19, 1:06 AM - Shona 😍: Though these were people somewhat close to me
4/28/19, 1:07 AM - Shona 😍: But does make me long for friendships
4/28/19, 1:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do I remind you of fun?
4/28/19, 1:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why don't you go to the church?
4/28/19, 1:07 AM - Shona 😍: That too
4/28/19, 1:07 AM - Shona 😍: I don't want to
4/28/19, 1:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How else can you meet people?
4/28/19, 1:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tinder?
4/28/19, 1:09 AM - Shona 😍: It feels like some kind of a project
4/28/19, 1:09 AM - Shona 😍: I think that's for finding something other than friendships
4/28/19, 1:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not necessarily
4/28/19, 1:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sleepy
4/28/19, 1:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night. I love you. 😗
4/28/19, 1:10 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
4/28/19, 1:10 AM - Shona 😍: I love you too.
4/28/19, 1:11 AM - Shona 😍: We can talk about that more later
4/28/19, 1:12 AM - Shona 😍: Somehow everything just seems so heavy atm
4/28/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe because I've got myself so deep in trouble  that getting out of it is just pure work
4/28/19, 1:14 AM - Shona 😍: And by trouble I mean socially isolated
4/28/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: But it is hard because it feels like I just need to learn everything all over again. Or from the beginning. I was listening to my 16-year-old cousin today and my God. He sounds so smart, much smarter than I did at that age! And I didn't expect th at of him at all! I guess my younger cousins are growing up too :)
4/28/19, 1:19 AM - Shona 😍: But he was actually having a meaningful conversation with Laura about the topics she knows a lot, like immigration, reafugees and climate change
4/28/19, 1:20 AM - Shona 😍: Very interesting day
4/28/19, 1:20 AM - Shona 😍: And we played the funniest games, I seriously don't remember the last time I have laughed so much
4/28/19, 1:21 AM - Shona 😍: I'm pretty sure the last time was with you though
4/28/19, 1:21 AM - Shona 😍: Btw is that profile pic from Espoo?
4/28/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm sorry for the monologue
4/28/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: I just have lot of things I wanted to talk to you about
4/28/19, 9:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/28/19, 9:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😊
4/28/19, 9:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. We have to talk about it.
4/28/19, 9:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I had a very bad dream. I was doing a Euro trip with some people I know from college. They were really boring company. I kept going with them wherever they wanted but then came a point where we all came back nd they were studying (I have no idea why, bunch of losers I guess) but then I wanted to go to this really cool water park right in the center of the city. It was a really cool water park because I was able to see it from the balcony of the hotel where we were staying. So, these people were not willing to go. But then they started making all kinds of excuses like it's very costly etc etc but it wasn't so then they half heartedly agreed to go but then they all kept delaying and nobody actually moved a single inch they just kept making lame excuses and I kept believing them. Then finally they just said to my face that they were never planning to leave and they were faking it all the while. By that time the water park had closed and they all didn't go and I was so bummed that I kept crying like how can they do that!
4/28/19, 9:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby. 😊
4/28/19, 10:01 AM - Shona 😍: Oh no :(
4/28/19, 10:01 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning kulta
4/28/19, 10:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What's your plan for the day?
4/28/19, 10:20 AM - Shona 😍: Don't have much planned
4/28/19, 10:20 AM - Shona 😍: Practicing the play
4/28/19, 10:21 AM - Shona 😍: Cleaning at 1.30 and taking Mikko to work
4/28/19, 10:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me know if you want to talk.
4/28/19, 10:25 AM - Shona 😍: Of course I want to talk
4/28/19, 10:25 AM - Shona 😍: Do you?
4/28/19, 10:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
4/28/19, 10:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am home rn. Will reach hostel in about half an hour.
4/28/19, 10:26 AM - Shona 😍: Cool!
4/28/19, 10:26 AM - Shona 😍: 😚
4/28/19, 10:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😗
4/28/19, 10:26 AM - Shona 😍: 👀
4/28/19, 10:58 AM - Shona 😍: Please call me when you reach and are free ❤
4/28/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok Shona.
4/28/19, 11:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey darling
4/28/19, 11:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am free now.
4/28/19, 12:17 PM - Shona 😍: I'm about to have breakfast
4/28/19, 1:49 PM - Shona 😍: All words seem very hollow right now. I wish I could offer you some comfort. I just feel very down myself. I feel like I didn't do well enough in the exam yesterday. With some of the questions I actually didn't know what I was doing, even in chemistry. They seemed so complicated and I felt disappointed in myself that I couldn't figure them out. I felt stupid yesterday when my 16-year-old cousin was having a conversation with Laura thinking that I don't know that much. And why am I not that open minded and so... somehow in touch with myself and life. It felt like I don't know who I am again. And not talking with you these past days has been really tough. Just seeing you and hearing your voice filled my heart with joy but at the same time it hurt all the more because it's still a long time until I can be with you again. Well long is relative. But it feels like an eternity on these kind of days.
4/28/19, 4:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey baby
4/28/19, 4:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I'm sorry I slept very hard.
4/28/19, 4:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was gone for 1 hours.
4/28/19, 4:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In 46 degrees without a fan 😨🥵
4/28/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: Np
4/28/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: Good you got some sleep
4/28/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: 🥵🥵
4/28/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: I'm at the office
4/28/19, 5:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to clean with you! ❤
4/28/19, 5:40 PM - Shona 😍: ❤
4/28/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://qz.com/708438/the-parenting-happiness-gap-is-real-new-research-confirms/
4/28/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Back at homem
4/28/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *?
4/28/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: After listening to the chapter 8 in the power of habit I thought you were right about the community thing. However then I started to listen to a podcast given by a Finnish actor. He talks about all things related to everyday life, relationships with other people, shame, being Finnish... It's, such a warm podcast. And I thought I'm not gonna demand it from myself that I find some kind of a tight community right now. These are small steps that I've taken with the theater class and Bhangra, and for now it's good enough. After the exam I can reasses the situation. Or maybe earlier. But I don't want to stress about it
4/28/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah looong time ago
4/28/19, 8:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to talk?
4/28/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: Sure. I'm just about to finish dinner or lunch or whatever this meal is 😬
4/28/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am very sorry darling
4/28/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For the way I have been behaving lately
4/28/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not in a good place these days.
4/28/19, 8:48 PM - Shona 😍: Shona wait just a bit
4/28/19, 8:55 PM - Shona 😍: What behavior are you referring to?
4/28/19, 8:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not talking
4/28/19, 8:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being rude like yesterday
4/28/19, 8:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Getting high
4/28/19, 8:56 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/28/19, 8:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am back to my abusing self.
4/28/19, 8:57 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/28/19, 8:57 PM - Shona 😍: I feel very numb rn
4/28/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Same.
4/28/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Life seems like a project
4/28/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It seems like I have to change everything about me.
4/28/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just am full of so many vices.
4/28/19, 8:58 PM - Shona 😍: I can relate
4/28/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's good to stay in control
4/28/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the minute you dose off a bit
4/28/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The second it gets out of hand
4/28/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then it's so easy to loose control
4/28/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But so hard to stay in it
4/28/19, 8:59 PM - Shona 😍: Is that then maybe about trying to control too much?
4/28/19, 9:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well the things that I am trying to control have to go away
4/28/19, 9:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is no way out
4/28/19, 9:00 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/28/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: I honestly feel like getting really drunk and forgetting that this week happened
4/28/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something that crossed my mind as well
4/28/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then as I said
4/28/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's easy to loose it
4/28/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And takes forever to conquer
4/28/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But would you want to do that.
4/28/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would really like to get drunk with you
4/28/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something I have been craving for since I came to India.
4/28/19, 9:05 PM - Shona 😍: I won't. I need to study next week.
4/28/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So? You can sleep and it will go away in the morning?
4/28/19, 9:06 PM - Shona 😍: It won't
4/28/19, 9:06 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not gonna do it today
4/28/19, 9:06 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe on May day
4/28/19, 9:07 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe not
4/28/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May day?
4/28/19, 9:07 PM - Shona 😍: 1st of May
4/28/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why 1st of May then?
4/28/19, 9:07 PM - Shona 😍: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day
4/28/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: It's a common holiday and a day of celebration
4/28/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😇
4/28/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: Also mentor suggested I don't study then
4/28/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: But I think I will
4/28/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good.
4/28/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: I have the interview on Tuesday
4/28/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. All the best for that.
4/28/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: Kiitos kulta
4/28/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But why do you feel numb when I tell you that I lost control?
4/28/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you fed up of the relapses?
4/28/19, 9:10 PM - Shona 😍: I feel numb because of my own life
4/28/19, 9:10 PM - Shona 😍: This week
4/28/19, 9:10 PM - Shona 😍: I feel a bit sick
4/28/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Physically?
4/28/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel a little dizzy myself
4/28/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: In every way
4/28/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know the feeling. I'm feeling it too.
4/28/19, 9:12 PM - Shona 😍: Wow we're not having a good day and week
4/28/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well mine is not a surprise
4/28/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't go to the support group meeting today
4/28/19, 9:13 PM - Shona 😍: Why shona?
4/28/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It felt like such a futile exercise
4/28/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a question for you
4/28/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will you judge me if I choose to do weed
4/28/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will you leave me?
4/28/19, 9:15 PM - Shona 😍: In general?
4/28/19, 9:16 PM - Shona 😍: To what extent
4/28/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Once a week
4/28/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or a month maybe
4/28/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean there is no schedule
4/28/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I drink
4/28/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I don't drink on a regular interval
4/28/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I only do it occasionally
4/28/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't like alcohol anymore
4/28/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I was thinking of replacing it
4/28/19, 9:18 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's about judging but rather a question for me if I want to be in a relationship with someone who does it... often
4/28/19, 9:20 PM - Shona 😍: I honestly don't know
4/28/19, 9:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why so
4/28/19, 9:21 PM - Shona 😍: But once a week sounds quite a lot
4/28/19, 9:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If alcohol is fine then why not weed
4/28/19, 9:21 PM - Shona 😍: Good question. I'm not an advocate for getting drunk weekly either
4/28/19, 9:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And not that I plan to do it weekly but what's the objective threshold . Time wise
4/28/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know.
4/28/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: I think the problem for me is the negative mental or physical health effects
4/28/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: Like what does it do in long term use
4/28/19, 9:26 PM - Shona 😍: Do we have to have this conversation now?
4/28/19, 9:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
4/28/19, 9:27 PM - Shona 😍: But what the heck when if not now
4/28/19, 9:27 PM - Shona 😍: I mean we can continue later
4/28/19, 9:28 PM - Shona 😍: Do you think you'd like to do it for the rest of your life?
4/28/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No!
4/28/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not at all
4/28/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's just that my life rn. It seems such a waste
4/28/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean there is nothing to do
4/28/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At all
4/28/19, 9:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Everything seems like a project
4/28/19, 9:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I feel like I can do it rn
4/28/19, 9:29 PM - Shona 😍: Okay well that's a relief
4/28/19, 9:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call?
4/29/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: Good night.
4/29/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night.
4/29/19, 3:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A survey of street player music performers in the European region. A section based deep dive ethnographic study. Interviews and longitudinal research. 
I know you are mad at me and there will be a seperate sorry message for that but please take this on a very objective intellectual basis this idea that I am sharing. If a professor agrees then this can be a very good sociological and psychological study for the culture and may be of anthropology too. Seriously look at how elegant it is.
4/29/19, 3:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Occupationally they all so have unique cultural similarity
4/29/19, 8:32 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
4/29/19, 9:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
4/29/19, 3:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: hey
4/29/19, 3:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: can we please talk?
4/29/19, 3:14 PM - Shona 😍: I've been out of my mind since last night. I just spoke for an hour about this with someone and now I feel somewhat sane again. The timing of this was horrible, but I guess that's what happens if problems are just kept out of sight like I've done a lot. I'm sorry I have not been really involved in this lately.
4/29/19, 3:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand the gravity of the situation. I am ashamed and am guilty myself. Please forgive me.
4/29/19, 3:38 PM - Shona 😍: I feel completely exhausted from the strong emotions and shitty sleep, I can't get anything done. Can we discuss this now? At least to some extent, I don't know how long it takes?
4/29/19, 3:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
4/29/19, 3:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My hands are shaking
4/29/19, 3:43 PM - Shona 😍: Texting or video call?
4/29/19, 6:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can we talk?
4/29/19, 7:14 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
4/29/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: I just got on the bus
4/29/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: Missed voice call
4/29/19, 7:42 PM - Shona 😍: Are you fine?
4/29/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not. 🙁
4/29/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am having second thoughts about the exam
4/29/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean what the heck is the problem of the professors these days.
4/29/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They don't teach shit
4/29/19, 7:46 PM - Shona 😍: Oh no
4/29/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then ask questions like... 😒
4/29/19, 7:47 PM - Shona 😍: Because you haven't studied?
4/29/19, 7:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because there is nothing to study and I am freaking out as to what am I supposed to do?
4/29/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: Nothing to study? They didn't tell what you need to study?
4/29/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They didn't teach anything 🙁
4/29/19, 7:49 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaaat 😨
4/29/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: Well all of you students are then in the same situation. They can't demand anything impossible from you can they? Though based on what you've told I don't know what they can do there..
4/29/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am going to study for another 4 hours.
4/29/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And let's see how much I am able to do in that
4/29/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: Okay. I just reached the class.
4/30/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: Hey
4/30/19, 12:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
4/30/19, 12:10 AM - Shona 😍: Can we talk?
4/30/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not yet baby. I am studying
4/30/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will take me at least 30 mins.
4/30/19, 12:38 AM - Shona 😍: Okay. Let's not talk tonight. I feel like a roadkill already and I need to prepare and go to the interview tomorrow and study in addition to that. And you have your exam. All the best for that, I hope you've got some sense into what you're supposed to know for it. I love you. I'm sorry things have turned out like this. I'm sorry for my indifference. It is tough when we deal with core beliefs and values, their evaluation requires a whole lot of mental effort and energy. Rakas. ❤.
4/30/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
4/30/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can we please talk?
4/30/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am done
4/30/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: Shona I don't have it in me
4/30/19, 12:54 AM - Shona 😍: It is not gonna be short if we start
4/30/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok darling
4/30/19, 1:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just wanted to kiss you good night
4/30/19, 1:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you. I was picking my nose and I remembered you. I felt like sitting on your lap and doing it. I wish to bury my nose in your neck and blow on it while sitting on you. I started smiling with the thought of ploughing my nose. I wanted to do it with you. I feel really close to you. Despite the differences. Despite the distances. I think it's a very new feeling. It's the feeling of being secure. Omg! It went away! The thought of you leaving me! I just realized!! I mean even after such a big conflict I feel safe to you. I feel like   I can faulter in my life and for the first time someone cares. They will punish me but not hurt me they will reprimand me but caress me and most importantly they may hate me but they will love me. I love you darling. 😭
4/30/19, 1:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: :')
4/30/19, 1:36 AM - Shona 😍: I love you too. Good night rakas.
4/30/19, 1:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok?

4/30/19, 3:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love the way you are
4/30/19, 3:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But rn
4/30/19, 3:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We need SuperHanna
4/30/19, 3:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She is awesome!
4/30/19, 3:37 PM - Shona 😍: I was also thinking about what it means to you and your family and your mum
4/30/19, 3:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have so many stories to tell for  you to gauge the depth of how much it means to me.
4/30/19, 3:40 PM - Shona 😍: I'm looking forward to hearing them.
4/30/19, 3:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you did not study at all this week yet?
4/30/19, 3:43 PM - Shona 😍: Well I studied 4h yesterday but it wasn't very good studying..
4/30/19, 3:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you like it?
4/30/19, 3:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh. But still better than nothing.
4/30/19, 3:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Dont worry. We will make up for it. Together.😊
4/30/19, 3:44 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm your expression is somehow unusual
4/30/19, 3:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good way or bad way?
4/30/19, 3:45 PM - Shona 😍: I meant to talk to you about it. I'll get back to it in the evening
4/30/19, 3:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok.
4/30/19, 3:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Unusual how shona?
4/30/19, 3:46 PM - Shona 😍: To me it just looks a bit strange, like not a real smile
4/30/19, 3:46 PM - Shona 😍: Just a posing "smile" I guess 😬
4/30/19, 3:47 PM - Shona 😍: I think everyone has their posing faces
4/30/19, 3:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 3:47 PM - Shona 😍: 🥳🥳🥳🥳
4/30/19, 3:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok?
4/30/19, 3:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In that case can you do me a favor?
4/30/19, 3:48 PM - Shona 😍: ?
4/30/19, 3:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you please select a suitable picture for my profile?
4/30/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
4/30/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
4/30/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: I'm just about to reach
4/30/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: What does suitable even mean
4/30/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: But this
4/30/19, 3:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not the sort of person who probes into their partners social media
4/30/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I will really like it if you freely use mine.
4/30/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/30/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All the best!
4/30/19, 3:50 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmhmm
4/30/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something that you may like?
4/30/19, 3:50 PM - Shona 😍: Thanks 😚
4/30/19, 3:51 PM - Shona 😍: I see
4/30/19, 3:51 PM - Shona 😍: 👋🏻
4/30/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ✌🏻
4/30/19, 4:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did it go baby?
4/30/19, 4:47 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 5:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you don't sound excited?
4/30/19, 5:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But anyways. It seemed important to you. And the fact that you got where you wanted to be is awesome. On top of it, the summers are finally setting in place and you are at last making it to the hospital for the position you wanted. No more cleaning. Doing a desk job. Yay!
4/30/19, 5:05 PM - Shona 😍: Weeeell I kind of expected to get the job. And I pretty much know the basics of how it's gonna be. It's definitely nice to have some work for the summer and the pay is quite nice for that kind of a job. I can make it more interesting to me by trying to improve myself within the job, like trying to be faster. And it's a nice change that I'll be working in different locations and not just one. And I get to choose all the shifts I do.
4/30/19, 5:06 PM - Shona 😍: No!!
4/30/19, 5:07 PM - Shona 😍: It is the cleaning 😂😂😂 the desk job would've been for the whole summer I think and that wasn't something I could've committed to
4/30/19, 5:07 PM - Shona 😍: So that's why I'm not that excited
4/30/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh 😄
4/30/19, 5:07 PM - Shona 😍: Or more excited
4/30/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well we will make it exciting then.
4/30/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We will find a way to make it stimulating enough
4/30/19, 5:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know how. But if that's what you want.
4/30/19, 5:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then we will do something about it.
4/30/19, 5:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How much is the pay?
4/30/19, 5:08 PM - Shona 😍: Well I just wanted to make some money during the summer too, and there weren't many options with my schedule
4/30/19, 5:09 PM - Shona 😍: 12,06€/hour
4/30/19, 5:09 PM - Shona 😍: Or 11,55
4/30/19, 5:09 PM - Shona 😍: Depends if it's a hospital or health care center
4/30/19, 5:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😳
4/30/19, 5:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's a very healthy pay.
4/30/19, 5:10 PM - Shona 😍: Yup
4/30/19, 5:10 PM - Shona 😍: For now
4/30/19, 5:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You earn more than me 😄
4/30/19, 5:10 PM - Shona 😍: 😁
4/30/19, 5:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you! ❤
4/30/19, 5:10 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too baby 😙
4/30/19, 5:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I started reading Grit. Finished the first chapter. 😊
4/30/19, 5:11 PM - Shona 😍: Oh!
4/30/19, 5:11 PM - Shona 😍: But shona? Did you do the project yet?
4/30/19, 5:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Procrastinating 😒
4/30/19, 5:12 PM - Shona 😍: Babyyy
4/30/19, 5:12 PM - Shona 😍: Please
4/30/19, 5:12 PM - Shona 😍: Please
4/30/19, 5:12 PM - Shona 😍: Just start doing it
4/30/19, 5:12 PM - Shona 😍: Is there some specific reason why you don't want to do it?
4/30/19, 5:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know I can do it. Why am I not doing it? 🤷🏻‍♂
4/30/19, 5:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a about self efficacy. I don't think I am capable enough to write a good book chapter.
4/30/19, 5:14 PM - Shona 😍: Okay those two messages are conflicting
4/30/19, 5:14 PM - Shona 😍: And you told me you can make changes after the first draft
4/30/19, 5:14 PM - Shona 😍: So it doesn't need to be perfect right away
4/30/19, 5:15 PM - Shona 😍: I too know that you can do it
4/30/19, 5:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that is how I feel.
4/30/19, 5:15 PM - Shona 😍: And maybe it's just inertia too
4/30/19, 5:16 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand
4/30/19, 5:17 PM - Shona 😍: How about starting small? Just telling yourself all you gotta do is write one paragraph? Or just a single sentence? Or just put on a timer for 25min or 50min and then just start writing stuff down, no matter how bad or good it is
4/30/19, 5:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will do the timer
4/30/19, 5:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But first I am going to eat something
4/30/19, 5:18 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds great.
4/30/19, 6:07 PM - Shona 😍: I can't seem to study. I came to the library but I have zero energy left in me. I was gonna study less anyway this week and next, but not this little. I thought I'll do 2h after the interview but I feel like I have nothing left in me again. I wonder if it's a bad idea to take the rest of the day off and do a good day tomorrow. It's not like there's any extra time left but trying to study like this feels very useless. In these moments I wonder though if there's some secret energy source in me that I haven't yet tapped into. It doesn't feel like I did much today, even though I spent the first half of the day with the interview business
4/30/19, 6:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Here is an idea. Don't take the day off completely. You will later feel bad that you wasted the whole day. But don't study uselessly if you can't study at all. What you should do instead is that somehow you should take a different route completely. For eg, when back in the time I used to prepare, there used to be times when I felt like this, so instead of ramming my brains into it what I did instead was I studied for enjoyment. I used to take up a particular topic that I really liked or was very easy and then used to enjoy doing it slowly, like some leisure activity. In a very relaxing way. So later in retrospect if I looked back I was always able to tell myself that at least I did something and I also enjoyed what I did. No matter how little
4/30/19, 6:13 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. That's interesting. I will try that.
4/30/19, 6:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I used to lie down on my bed and just enjoy reading inorganic chemistry.
4/30/19, 6:14 PM - Shona 😍: :)
4/30/19, 6:14 PM - Shona 😍: Kiitos kulta ❤
4/30/19, 6:15 PM - Shona 😍: Did you start yet yourself?
4/30/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. Not the writing part but I found something very interesting
4/30/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I have your Facebook password and Id? I need it for the research. I already used mine but I need another
4/30/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can say no.
4/30/19, 6:19 PM - Shona 😍: Okay? What info do you need from there?
4/30/19, 6:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Some of your Facebook data. Mainly your likes and comments.
4/30/19, 6:19 PM - Shona 😍: 😁
4/30/19, 6:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will download a file and then upload it somewhere.
4/30/19, 6:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's it. No nose poking in your chat with the hospital dude. :P
4/30/19, 6:21 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂😂
4/30/19, 6:21 PM - Shona 😍: You wouldn't understand it anyway
4/30/19, 6:21 PM - Shona 😍: Though I kinda wouldn't care if you read that
4/30/19, 6:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona. Can we talk later? Time is a little less on myself side.
4/30/19, 6:22 PM - Shona 😍: Yes!!!
4/30/19, 6:22 PM - Shona 😍: Btw
4/30/19, 6:22 PM - Shona 😍: I think you're my secret energy source 😳
4/30/19, 6:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh? 😄
4/30/19, 6:24 PM - Shona 😍: Well somehow I feel much better now and it feels like I can do it
4/30/19, 6:24 PM - Shona 😍: The advice was good too
4/30/19, 6:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby.
4/30/19, 6:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The password?
4/30/19, 6:40 PM - Shona 😍: rodienelli08
4/30/19, 6:41 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow this feels quite weird to me
4/30/19, 6:41 PM - Shona 😍: But I guess I'm just used to being super private
4/30/19, 6:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Your id darling?
4/30/19, 6:41 PM - Shona 😍: The email?
4/30/19, 6:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
4/30/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: Hkkolehmainen@gmail.com
4/30/19, 6:52 PM - Shona 😍: Mm and hey are you gonna use just my likes and comments? I don't mind mine being used but I can't say that for my friends from some group discussions
4/30/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Chillax
4/30/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not going to read them myself
4/30/19, 6:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just need to check the efficacy of an online tool which will process the data
4/30/19, 6:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to test the tool but I can say for sure that it wrongly tells about mine. The only other person I know inside out is you. So with the point of view of introspection I can only check the effectiveness of the tool after checking your data.
4/30/19, 6:55 PM - Shona 😍: Interesting
4/30/19, 6:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I can't seem to download the file. 😒
4/30/19, 6:55 PM - Shona 😍: Oh
4/30/19, 6:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Its asking me questions about confirming my identity
4/30/19, 6:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the test is that I have to identify photos of your friends
4/30/19, 6:56 PM - Shona 😍: It knows you're not me:D
4/30/19, 6:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So can you please download the file and send it to me.
4/30/19, 6:56 PM - Shona 😍: Really??
4/30/19, 6:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good for you.
4/30/19, 6:56 PM - Shona 😍: What's the file?
4/30/19, 6:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Get amazed later. Help me out here 😄
4/30/19, 6:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Open your Facebook account

4/30/19, 6:57 PM - Shona 😍: And?
4/30/19, 7:01 PM - Shona 😍: I can't send it the file's too big
4/30/19, 7:02 PM - Shona 😍: Yiur email?
4/30/19, 7:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mail me?
4/30/19, 7:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: kbehari1995@gmail.com
4/30/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: Damn it
4/30/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: The max file size is even smaller!
4/30/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: Hey but I told fb it was me
4/30/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: Try again if you can download it yourself
4/30/19, 7:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/30/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: The one trying to log in from Kanpur 😬
4/30/19, 7:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Got it!
4/30/19, 7:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/30/19, 7:05 PM - Shona 😍: Perfect
4/30/19, 7:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thanks. I will let you know the results
4/30/19, 7:05 PM - Shona 😍: Okay 😁
4/30/19, 7:05 PM - Shona 😍: All da best
4/30/19, 7:05 PM - Shona 😍: I'll do bio now
4/30/19, 7:06 PM - Shona 😍: I had to change to a cafe in Jumbo, the library closed early bc of May Day eve
4/30/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
4/30/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just saw a dark abandoned staircase
4/30/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I was having ideas.
4/30/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: Ooooo
4/30/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: Are you making progress?
4/30/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very slowly.
4/30/19, 8:24 PM - Shona 😍: Well at least that's something.
4/30/19, 8:24 PM - Shona 😍: And same here
4/30/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well at least that's something
4/30/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/30/19, 8:24 PM - Shona 😍: 😁
4/30/19, 8:24 PM - Shona 😍: Exactly
4/30/19, 8:24 PM - Shona 😍: Yay us
4/30/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am facing a dilemma
4/30/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have the option of going to the movies with Faizal's friends
4/30/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know them well but I am acquainted
4/30/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am really interested in the movie.
4/30/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am unsure of the company
4/30/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hence the experience
4/30/19, 8:26 PM - Shona 😍: You don't like them? Or you don't know if you like them?
4/30/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I am kind of making a headstart with the project and it will take time before I produce anything meaningful
4/30/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And breaks certainly don't help
4/30/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: I can imagine
4/30/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I really want to watch the movie as well.
4/30/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: You mean texting or going to the movies or both
4/30/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is a really important movie
4/30/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Going to the movies.
4/30/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: How so?
4/30/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
4/30/19, 8:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it's a sequel to some 28 superhero movies so far. And I have watched all of them
4/30/19, 8:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And now people are just giving spoilers 😒
4/30/19, 8:28 PM - Shona 😍: Do you have adequate time before the internship starts to finish the project?
4/30/19, 8:28 PM - Shona 😍: Ooh
4/30/19, 8:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will have to finish it overnight
4/30/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: I see
4/30/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: You need to have it tomorrow?
4/30/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
4/30/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: Dear lord
4/30/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I am going to the movie
4/30/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will finish the project tonight
4/30/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Watch me!
4/30/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Decided!
4/30/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: I was gonna say the company isn't maybe so important in a movie, you'll be mostly quiet anyway :D
4/30/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: That's so not how I do things but you do what suits you
4/30/19, 8:31 PM - Shona 😍: If you know you can finish it well then
4/30/19, 8:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I can do it and it will be a fun night. It's been a long time since I challenged myself. In fact when I was being skeptical about the exam yesterday that is exactly what I thought, that I will not be able to do it but then I calmed myself down looked at the watch and said there are 12 hours. Armies can be defeated in that span. What's with a course. I studied and then I did it.
4/30/19, 8:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think if I just have that attitude right from the beginning then I _will_ be able to do it.
4/30/19, 8:36 PM - Shona 😍: Well that's just great. I remember you telling you like allnighters.
4/30/19, 8:36 PM - Shona 😍: You know it yourself
4/30/19, 8:36 PM - Shona 😍: You can if you want to
4/30/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: For me, they usually make me cry :D
4/30/19, 8:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. I can imagine.
4/30/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: I absolutely hate them
4/30/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: But as said, you surely can do it
4/30/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't usually do the whole night but generally am able to sleep for 2-3 hours and am done by 4am in the morning
4/30/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
4/30/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds slightly more humane
4/30/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: Just slightly though :D
4/30/19, 8:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
4/30/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's me laughing btw and it's not a breathing exercise
4/30/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No! 😄
4/30/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen. Just go home lie down on your bed naked and study. Try that. It will be fun
4/30/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What was lieing there?
4/30/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: This
4/30/19, 8:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh God!
4/30/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that's good. Studies arouse you so...
4/30/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wouldn't you want to explore that side?
4/30/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen, the day for you is already fucked so why not enjoy it anyways
4/30/19, 8:45 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:45 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In about two hours but people are going to leave rn
4/30/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I were you, I would have totally masturbated
4/30/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Trying to figure that out
4/30/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:48 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:48 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. I am going to leave rn
4/30/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will _study_ when I come back
4/30/19, 8:53 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
4/30/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
4/30/19, 8:53 PM - Shona 😍: Have fun!
4/30/19, 8:53 PM - Shona 😍: I believe (in) you
4/30/19, 8:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it elates my heart to know that.
4/30/19, 8:54 PM - Shona 😍: PUCCHA
4/30/19, 8:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Puccha baby
4/30/19, 8:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But if I were you I would have totally held the physics questions in my hand even if for a second when I am about to come.
4/30/19, 8:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Omg! That is so hot!
4/30/19, 8:56 PM - Shona 😍: :DDD
4/30/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to touch your cunt rn.
4/30/19, 8:57 PM - Shona 😍: Mmmh
4/30/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Literally rub my fingers on it
4/30/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On that staircase
4/30/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With you against the wall
4/30/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And your right leg higher to left one by three steps
4/30/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Revealing your cunt
4/30/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I spit on my hand
4/30/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And slap it
4/30/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Splashing my saliva on you
4/30/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And your legs
4/30/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the sound that it will make! Omg.
4/30/19, 8:58 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm let's find a staircase sometime
4/30/19, 9:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then I will rub my hand on your cunt like this
4/30/19, 9:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 9:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry I have to go
4/30/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My manager just called
4/30/19, 9:03 PM - Shona 😍: Your manager? 😁
4/30/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At Macquarie
4/30/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It so did not go well. 😒
4/30/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I had not prepared my elevator pitch
4/30/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😒
4/30/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just a dumbass
4/30/19, 9:32 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaaaaat I thought that was a joke and it was your friend or something
4/30/19, 9:32 PM - Shona 😍: What was it about
4/30/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About the internship
4/30/19, 9:33 PM - Shona 😍: You're not a dumbass don't say that!!
4/30/19, 9:33 PM - Shona 😍: I got that
4/30/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it was not that bad.
4/30/19, 9:33 PM - Shona 😍: But what about it
4/30/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What it is about. And what will I do and what he expects and what should I learn before the internship
4/30/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/1/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby?
5/1/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did it go?
5/1/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The studying
5/1/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how are you?
5/1/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's almost your sleep time
5/1/19, 12:26 AM - Shona 😍: I was pretty much half asleep yesterday when I read it, that's why I didn't reply properly. I think if we can work our way through difficult conflicts, we will feel closer afterwards. This one we didn't finish yet, but we did get to a much better place from where we can continue the conversation. That brings me to another point, actually more of a favor, that I need to ask from you. You've been incredibly supportive and understanding throughout my preparation for the exam and I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate it. It means the world to me and it's been of such great help. Slowly I'm beginning to understand how precious it is when someone truly is there for you. Like I think I said on Sunday, it's been a very long time since I've had that with someone. Someone being there for me or me being there for someone. And I was a child back then, I think it's, at least to some extent, different when being adults. And in a romantic relationship or life partnership maybe on a different level than what it is in a friendship. But I want to do it. I want to take your problems to be my problems too. I want to know, I want to be involved and invested. I may need reminders from you or myself, as it's not something that's learned over night. It feels a bit bad to ask what I'm gonna ask. Bad because it's a step away from being more involved and truly facing the problems instead of looking away, even if for a very short while. Timings will never be perfect in life but they can be better and they can be worse, and to some extent we can control that. Not entirely, and sometimes problems will come up and blow up in our faces at the worst possible time, like on Sunday and yesterday. And I'm sure it will happen again in a different form, and then we're just gonna have to try to be brave and face it. What I wanted to ask was that we could delay discussing this topic further, and other possible really difficult topics after my exam. Needless to say yesterday's and today's studying were shit, and I don't think I can afford more of that. And maybe more than that, I wouldn't want to think I didn't do well enough in the exam, God forbid that it should happen, because I was so distracted for the last few weeks I couldn't do proper revision. Less than two weeks of revision is not much anyway, and of course the vast vast majority of the work I've done is behind me. And I know you know how much work I've put into this exam, and that I've actually used two years and (literally) at least two thousand hours from my life preparing for it. So I would really want to be  able to be focused and able to give my best and not completely drained from emotional roller coasters and the heaviest possible conversations. I don't mean we couldn't talk about anything serious at all. But just not putting pressure on figuring out the difficult questions right now. We now know that you're internship starts before my exam is over. And neither of us knows exactly how it will be like for you when it starts, how much hard work, time and effort that will take each day. So I don't know if time and energy-wise the situation will be any better. But still I'm gonna ask that we postpone the discussions, because of the reasons that I said. Can we please do that?
5/1/19, 12:26 AM - Shona 😍: I didn't study anymore
5/1/19, 12:26 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah
5/1/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes darling of course. We can. Its not shying away or running away from it but rather it will be a very wise thing to do. As I have said, dissent can exist with love. I am guilty for what I did but that doesn't change the fact that you have your exam in 2 weeks. So we are going to focus on the studying and keep those shitty topics aside for a while.
5/1/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: Thank you ❤.
5/1/19, 1:23 AM - Shona 😍: Good night darling. I hope the night of work is gonna be if not enjoyable then at least bearable. I know you can do it. I love you, my moon and stars, my secret energy supply. Hmm if you're the energy energy supply then maybe you're the sun. But I can't photosynthesize so I couldn't utilize it 🤔
5/1/19, 1:23 AM - Shona 😍: Anyhow. Good night ❤
5/1/19, 9:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: good morning
5/1/19, 9:41 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
5/1/19, 9:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometimes, I read your morning messages and then I see you vanish. I know you are trying to be crazy fast in your routine and that you will only talk to me when you get on the bus. And I really like that about you. Your grit. Your resolve. Your drive but sometimes I imagine, that you will give up everything just come running to me, sit in my lap and that's how we will spend the rest of the day. ❤
5/1/19, 10:11 AM - Shona 😍: That's the dream. I hope some day I could do that.
5/1/19, 10:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: An advice for that day. If the day ever comes that you want to do it then don't worry about the fact that I may have work or that you may have it. Just close your eyes. Shut off your phone and sit in my lap. Rest Will handle itself

5/1/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: After reading this. I feel like i should just break up with you
5/1/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I dont want my genes to be passed on to our children 😂
5/1/19, 10:54 AM - Shona 😍: What do your genes have to do with the city being polluted?
5/1/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What do I know. Bodies are complicated 😂
5/1/19, 10:55 AM - Shona 😍: Well it's only an exception when the environment affects the expression of genes
5/1/19, 10:56 AM - Shona 😍: I mean so that it would be inherited!
5/1/19, 10:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know. 😒 I M k I d d I n g
5/1/19, 10:56 AM - Shona 😍: Well bad reason to break up
5/1/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you have a good one?
5/1/19, 10:58 AM - Shona 😍: Where do I even begin the answer
5/1/19, 10:58 AM - Shona 😍: I won't
5/1/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Noooo
5/1/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
5/1/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Say
5/1/19, 10:59 AM - Shona 😍: No, it would just be a speculation of possible scenarios and that's not useful
5/1/19, 10:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/1/19, 10:59 AM - Shona 😍: And also not something that should be discussed rn
5/1/19, 11:00 AM - Shona 😍: You have the project to work on
5/1/19, 11:00 AM - Shona 😍: I gotta study
5/1/19, 11:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. 😒
5/1/19, 11:02 AM - Shona 😍: Babyyyyy no more procrastination plz
5/1/19, 11:02 AM - Shona 😍: We will talk
5/1/19, 11:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.

5/1/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What's your score?
5/1/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you get an email yet?
5/1/19, 3:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you!
5/1/19, 3:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: These days I just keep humming this song
5/1/19, 3:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/XBIYD3h1olY
5/1/19, 3:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And everytime I sing it, it reminds me of you. And how much I love you.
5/1/19, 3:20 PM - Shona 😍: It comes tomorrow since today is a common holiday
5/1/19, 3:20 PM - Shona 😍: 💝
5/1/19, 3:48 PM - Shona 😍: I feel like saying fuck absolutely everything, staying in my bed for the next two weeks, giving the exam and taking a flight directly to France to Taize (the place I've told you about, for silence and prayer etc) and staying there for a year as a volunteer. How can I ever become anything if my nerves are gonna get the best of me and I shatter before challenges. I'm verry sorry you have to listen to this. I know you have your own work. Please feel free to reply later. If I say anything to mum she's just gonna say stay strong, only a little while left or something as useful. It's not helpful at all.
5/1/19, 4:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😊
5/1/19, 4:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You finally opened up.

5/1/19, 6:48 PM - Shona 😍: Still kinda feel like ripping my head off
5/1/19, 6:49 PM - Shona 😍: But I appreciate it
5/1/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/1/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want to intrude in your solitude
5/1/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But my advice is that please call me
5/1/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Even if you have nothing to say
5/1/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's try talking
5/1/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Who knows maybe you will feel better
5/1/19, 7:39 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know how to do that without touching the difficult topics
5/1/19, 7:40 PM - Shona 😍: They've been on my mind too
5/1/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then get them off your mind. You are almost done with studying. They will take about 4 hours. And rest will be fine after that.
5/1/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have to get it out of your system
5/1/19, 7:50 PM - Shona 😍: I think what I actually need is some alone time.
5/1/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You want a break?
5/1/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: No I mean today
5/1/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok

5/1/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Are you high?
5/1/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/1/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/1/19, 10:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You upset about it?
5/1/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: No..
5/1/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well didn't you promise to drink?
5/1/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not gonna
5/1/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: Would just make me feel worse
5/1/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was this your way of starting a conversation or you were actually curious?
5/1/19, 10:52 PM - Shona 😍: Of course I was curious! I thought you were gonna tell her today
5/1/19, 10:52 PM - Shona 😍: And it's a huge deal
5/1/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it seems to me that there is absolutely no necessity to say that the opposite is equally likely
5/1/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am planning to record her reaction
5/1/19, 10:52 PM - Shona 😍: That it would've made me feel better?
5/1/19, 10:53 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah you told :)
5/1/19, 10:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/1/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like telling you my trail of thoughts

5/1/19, 10:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish you were interested
5/1/19, 10:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But seems to me that you are disgusted
5/1/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: Kunju
5/1/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not disgusted
5/1/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: I just don't feel good
5/1/19, 10:59 PM - Shona 😍: Doesn't have to do with you being high
5/1/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby...
5/1/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want me use the eternal solution?
5/1/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: 😕
5/1/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: Can I get a pic?

5/2/19, 9:47 AM - Shona 😍: 😳🤭
5/2/19, 9:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will always hold you  like that. No matter what comes down 🤗
5/2/19, 9:59 AM - Shona 😍: Your pants seem to be what come down 🤭
5/2/19, 9:59 AM - Shona 😍: I'm kidding, that's really sweet ❤
5/2/19, 10:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤
5/2/19, 11:19 AM - Shona 😍: I finished chapter 9. I get it better now.
5/2/19, 11:20 AM - Shona 😍: ❤.
5/2/19, 11:29 AM - Shona 😍: Another thing. I thought more about love as a healthy addiction. To me it also feels like that in many ways, and maybe to some extent it's good. The danger is then that when these kind of conflicts happen, it is scary how much they affect me. I started to feel disgusted with myself and started to belittle myself. I'm not exactly sure why that happened. I also started to feel kind of numb and yesterday I felt like I've felt in the past, everything somehow lacking meaning and me being trapped in some kind of a fog.
5/2/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe what happened to me was because you have given me a new sense of meaning in life, and when it felt like that was taken away I didn't know what to do with myself, I felt lost. Maybe that isn't healthy. Or maybe it just is what happens. I don't understand it fully yet.
5/2/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: In any case
5/2/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: I love you
5/2/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna start studying

If it passes it will never come back. Who knows, we may not be able to meet in this life again. Then what? O my baby please hug me.
5/2/19, 6:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please read it and let me know your thoughts

5/3/19, 12:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Babyy
5/3/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: I'm sure😬
5/3/19, 12:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The boy's name is Ritik and the girls name is Riddi. You may not understand it but even for Hindi they are very very pretty names. They are twins. They are the children of my dentist. Whom I just met as a doctor. So when I was in class 9 I went to this dentist for my teeth(which you know by now that I don't take care of much). So I actually went to him because he was cheap. That was the time when he just had those two and that too after a long wait because he and his wife were having troubles in conceiving. and this dentist was so friendly and happy going. Kept cracking jokes and sarcastically talking about life and love. And this is the first time I am seeing him. Now to write on the prescription he asks me my name and I tell him Kunj. "Kunj, hmm , that's a nice name. Kunj. Hmm Kunj. Hmm." And then he went on to repeat it a few more times. He told me he Will name Ritik aS Kunj. I went back home smiling but then next time I went to him he told me that how is wife was not happy with the idea. 😄
We then eventually became very good friends. Our families met. And then we started hanging out more. He is of the kind who goes on night outs. Literally for the whole night. He once took 16 kids to a water park in a hatchback! Imagine that! We all had lot of fun with him. That was the time when Mom and Dad were having a lot of problems so at times he was our only source of fun
5/3/19, 12:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Today. Somehow I wanted to share with him the happiness of my pay cheque. So I went to him. As usual he was happy as he would have been if Ritwik would have gotten a job. I have not seen merrier and Kinder people. Rejoicing in other's joy. I love spending time with him. He is a very down to earth and a very helping person
5/3/19, 12:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know how sometimes someone just induces an emotion in you. For eg. He induces happiness. Mom induces peace. "Voldemort" induces stress. Guruji induces safety. Everyone is different. I wonder what I induce in you
5/3/19, 12:17 AM - Shona 😍: That is incredibly sweet. He sounds like a wonderful person!
5/3/19, 12:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am always amazed to see him. He makes me believe in humanity. 😇
5/3/19, 12:18 AM - Shona 😍: The best kind of people ❤
5/3/19, 12:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
5/3/19, 12:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was this for you? 😄
5/3/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Honey nut ice cream. Strawberry shake and watermelon. What a day!
5/3/19, 12:29 AM - Shona 😍: You induce many emotions in me, and of a wide variety depending on the current situation. But what seem to remain are especially safety and joy. And those are very very precious to me. I don't know how to describe it better. I don't know if love is an emotion too. That obviously too. That was such a deep question!
5/3/19, 12:29 AM - Shona 😍: :D
5/3/19, 12:30 AM - Shona 😍: It was adorable 😍😍
5/3/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You induce satisfaction on me. Whenever I get high I see you. I imagine your nose and then I imagine it being dry and chilled a little red. A slight bump on the nostrils and then it slowly merging with your cheeks. I don't why it's the nose that I imagine but the minute I imagine it, I feel loved, I feel safe both in the present and in the future. And maybe you don't get it but think about it that how much we trust the other person when we live with them. If I will live with you in the future then I Will trust you with my wealth and my health. And I feel so safe that you and only you will take care of it. How do I know you will? Because it's you. You always take care of stuff that is important to you. For eg your teeth. But I think the reason why I see your nose is because I vividly remember the texture of your skin especially on your nose. And then maybe it is also the phrase that somewhere remotely triggers a sense of pride. By holding your nose high. (I don't know if there is an English proverb such as that but there is one in Hindi)
5/3/19, 12:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wow! I really love you! Look at how much I want to tell you about my thoughts.
5/3/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you liked the question then take your time and answer it better. I am sure you will come up with something creative
5/3/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I remember correctly I used to bite your nose a lot?
5/3/19, 12:49 AM - Shona 😍: Well I just started listening to a new book that's called You are what you love. Whenever the narrator spoke of love and some innermost longing this sense of warmth washed over me and I just thought of you. And this morning I was so happy after we talked. I think about you and it makes me feel like I'm at home. Where I want to be. Today I also remembered the first time I was in Espoo and how we sat on the bench near your house and then got up and hugged. And then I just remembered your cheek against mine and your kisses on my cheeks. That felt so so sweet. Then I thought of lieing next to you, you wrapped around me and my face against your neck. That's the only place where I'd like to be. Every time I see you on your bed on a video call or in a pic I just think that and how I want to hug and squeeze you very tightly.
5/3/19, 12:49 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm you did
5/3/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's an interesting book title
5/3/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why was I not asked about reading this book together?
5/3/19, 12:51 AM - Shona 😍: I wasn't sure of it
5/3/19, 12:51 AM - Shona 😍: I remember my theologian friend reading it
5/3/19, 12:51 AM - Shona 😍: Then saw it on audible with high ratings
5/3/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/3/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to read this.
5/3/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me know if you would want to
5/3/19, 12:52 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe some time
5/3/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: I still am not sure. And I don't know if it's worth purchasing. I swapped it with another book from audible
5/3/19, 12:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh. Ok.
5/3/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: I thought of you though
5/3/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just was saying that I am still up for the idea of completing books together
5/3/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really like it
5/3/19, 12:54 AM - Shona 😍: Me too!
5/3/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hey. How was chapter 9?

5/3/19, 12:57 AM - Shona 😍: As I said, made me understand better what it's been like for you
5/3/19, 12:58 AM - Shona 😍: Shona
5/3/19, 12:58 AM - Shona 😍: It's getting late
5/3/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand
5/3/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But before you go
5/3/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please tell me about your day
5/3/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In detail
5/3/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can send an audio note
5/3/19, 1:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would really like to know about it
5/3/19, 1:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like posting our photo as a status
5/3/19, 1:06 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
5/3/19, 1:08 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
5/3/19, 1:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
5/3/19, 1:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now you can go
5/3/19, 1:12 AM - Shona 😍: :)

5/3/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: :D
5/3/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will have to observe your day and tell me things that are worth noting
5/3/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The constipation talk and the holding the ears insight was funnu
5/3/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *funny
5/3/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not kidding

5/3/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you will like doing that
5/3/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I love you and I love it when you tell about yourself like that
5/3/19, 1:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hey, I have a good idea. Infact a great one.
5/3/19, 1:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Remember the example of Alco from the book? The power of Habit? How the new CEO focused on worker safety
5/3/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
5/3/19, 1:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So turns out you fix the safety problem you fix everything
5/3/19, 1:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it's a keystone habit
5/3/19, 1:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know it's a little late to realize but for the rest of your preparation you can focus on increasing your attention span. It's a keystone habit and it will fix everything else automatically
5/3/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah... The attention span seems to vary like crazy though
5/3/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can go back to being a robot
5/3/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: Sometimes I have laser focus for very long
5/3/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Staying on your schedule
5/3/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/3/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will not text you the whole day
5/3/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: :/
5/3/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe for 2 weeks is fine.
5/3/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: Texting during breaks does not seem to help
5/3/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: Often times
5/3/19, 1:19 AM - Shona 😍: The focus
5/3/19, 1:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And we can talk whenever you feel very tired or down. I mean I am always there. You just have to call me. And I can't say this enough but the way you felt better after talking, you will always do. If you can't figure out on your own what's the problem then just call me.
5/3/19, 1:19 AM - Shona 😍: ❤❤
5/3/19, 1:19 AM - Shona 😍: I
5/3/19, 1:19 AM - Shona 😍: Love

5/3/19, 1:32 AM - Shona 😍: Never is
5/3/19, 1:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's not for you to judge
5/3/19, 1:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I send you crappy selfies all the time.
5/3/19, 1:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They seem crappy to me
5/3/19, 1:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But they seem good to you

5/3/19, 11:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ever
5/3/19, 11:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that you can find your focus in life 😉
5/3/19, 11:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/oTJ-oqwxdZY
5/3/19, 12:02 PM - Shona 😍: 😙
5/3/19, 12:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/3/19, 12:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am worried
5/3/19, 12:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am afraid I am the reason for your lack of focus
5/3/19, 12:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is there anything I can do to fix it? Please?
5/3/19, 12:03 PM - Shona 😍: It's the phone probably
5/3/19, 12:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Put it down on the floor
5/3/19, 12:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And jump on it
5/3/19, 12:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😡
5/3/19, 12:04 PM - Shona 😍: And yeah, it has to do with texting with you😬
5/3/19, 12:04 PM - Shona 😍: No
5/3/19, 12:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/3/19, 12:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mango
5/3/19, 12:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Finally
5/3/19, 12:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/VlPdfLr1FSo
5/3/19, 1:12 PM - Shona 😍: 😋❤
5/3/19, 4:49 PM - Shona 😍: Something to add to the list of difficult conversations. This triggers something very ugly in me. I didn't like this yesterday, and today when I remembered it again I realized I felt so offended that I actually felt like I want to hurt you back somehow. I have repeatedly told you I don't want to be called names. Maybe it will change at some point, maybe it won't. But for now. I. Don't. Like. It.
5/3/19, 6:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then it is a question of what both of us want. I mean I want to call you names and you don't want me to. We both want different things. Now obviously I am not going to call you names because you don't like it but if I  still feel like saying so then can I just not say that I feel like saying so? Not having said it how can you feel bad about it. I mean did i say any name yesterday? Or do I repeatedly do that? Because you really feel hurt. Just cause you don't like it, it doesn't mean it cant be sexy to me. And if it is indeed sexy to me and I feel like saying it then can I at least not mention that I feel like saying it? Is it that big a deal even if I just mention it?
5/3/19, 7:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/3/19, 7:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: was this too harsh?
5/3/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometimes I feel like my boobs are bigger than yours 😂
5/3/19, 8:35 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to think
5/3/19, 8:35 PM - Shona 😍: Sometimes even I don't understand my reactions
5/3/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: I have thought about that as a possibility 😅 and I'm just gonna say please go to the gym before that happens
5/3/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: Btw
5/3/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: I just had the best orgasm like, ever. I actually laughed for a good while afterwards I felt so... Euphoric
5/3/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: Also
5/3/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: My period is already over a week late
5/3/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: I think it's the stress
5/3/19, 8:48 PM - Shona 😍: I mean I don't exactly understand why I'm so sensitive about some things
5/3/19, 9:00 PM - Shona 😍: I also thought about doing weed
5/3/19, 9:00 PM - Shona 😍: Strange day
5/3/19, 9:00 PM - Shona 😍: But studying was a bit better
5/3/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: Better focus to some extent
5/3/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: And then I thought what the heck is happening to me, who is this person
5/3/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: And then that either I'm headed towards life itself or destruction
5/3/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: Weird shit seriously
5/3/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: It has to do with the damn book that I started
5/3/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. We need to talk.
5/3/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A lot.
5/3/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know when can we do that
5/3/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you miss me?
5/3/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: It feels so strange that you have been in this room
5/3/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What?
5/3/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Strange?
5/3/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: Like it was a million years ago
5/3/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I'm thinking all these things and feeling weird because everything is coming to an end
5/3/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: The exam will be over soon
5/3/19, 10:26 PM - Shona 😍: Theater and Bhangra classes will end
5/3/19, 10:26 PM - Shona 😍: Summer...
5/3/19, 10:26 PM - Shona 😍: I never really liked summer
5/3/19, 10:26 PM - Shona 😍: I mean of course I do
5/3/19, 10:27 PM - Shona 😍: But when I was at school the summer vacation always seemed so long! I actually missed school and all the routines
5/3/19, 10:31 PM - Shona 😍: I don't really want to work at the hospital
5/3/19, 10:32 PM - Shona 😍: It's boring as hell
5/3/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Now you are talking. Can we talk tonight? Or do you have to study tomorrow?
5/3/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Me 2
5/3/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Me 2!
5/3/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And and and you know there used be a lot of holiday homework for us so it never felt like a holiday. It just was por of admonitions and reprimands
5/3/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok? Let's discuss that please. I can understand that it is boring
5/3/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Ehhh I have a practise exam tomorrow :D did I again forget to tell you something like this...
5/3/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No baby. But I calculated. 😉
5/3/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Calculated what?
5/3/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: 🙂
5/3/19, 10:51 PM - Shona 😍: Anyhow I want to sleep at a reasonable hour
5/3/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
5/3/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I can finally text
5/3/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/3/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message
5/3/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/3/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: What did you censor?
5/3/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So, here it goes, there is always an option way of doing things. Beyond which they either seem boring or they stress you out. 
For the book chapter that I was about to write, the Challenges were obviously very high if not moderate but obviously since I had not written anything before it I certainly didn't have the skills for it and hence I felt anxiety loads and loads of it. To the point where I felt numb and stopped realizing that it was the project that was stressing me out because honestly I have slept for 14 hours in in the past 24, having myself relieved off the stress. 
My point being that this graph is accurate and it really sums up your situation beautifully. 
You have been working at the hospital for two years now and it certainly is boring because it is just a cleaning job afterall and it certainly poses less obstacles and obviously you have the skills for it. 
BUT(T- I really like yours 😁) , you have utilized the above graph unknowingly in your life before to remove such a similar situation. You increased the challenges of a very boring routine in the past only to achieve an optimum state that made you feel good about it. It was your morning routine. You fixed it to the point that now each day you enjoy it and again, in the past few days you have stopped enjoying it because now completing your routine in 1.5 hours is the new Normal and you are used to it because you have developed abilities to do so and now the challenge that it poses are low and hence it is just boring and seems like a project.
So my dear darling Shona. If I were you(which I am in a way❤) I wouldn't stress about the fact that the hospital job is boring. Because that is something I can make un-boring by just finding a way to increase the challenges.
5/3/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I get it, change can be scary, especially for you, but it doesn't have to be. I know you like your schedule, so we can find new purposes in Life and help you make a new schedule that keeps you busy and makes the anxiety go away. As we know how the summer will look like, we can make better decisions now.
5/3/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do me a favor, please look at our old pics. I have a feeling you Will feel better
5/3/19, 11:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So thats one biological indicator of the fact how your life is being affected in myraid ways. I can't tell you not to stress because I know it's the most futile advice but what I can do is help you solve your problems one by one on a case to case basis. What I can do is be a patient listener. What I can also do is be your indefinite support and be that forever. And please understand that I intend to be that, always. <3
5/3/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: Babyyyy ❤
5/3/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That may not be true. You can't blame it to the book what you have been building up inside you all your life. And thinking about weed is not destruction. It's curiosity in its innocent form and maybe yeah in its more destructive self it is self sabotage but that is the stage when you get addicted to it but since you haven't even tried it so you can't be addicted to it so being unknown to the experience and being the kind of person you are who always is able to control herself I don't see a reason why thinking about doing weed is destruction. If anything, I think it's the basic human instinct of curiosity and venturing into the unknown, which I think makes us human, the ability to make decisions and store hoardes of knowledge thanks to our pre frontal cortex
5/3/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's nice. 😇
5/3/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing important, it was just the image but it was not sent right
5/3/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. That is very true. Though I've only worked at the hospital last summer, not before that. And there are some things I didn't learn properly then, like cleaning a room after someone with something very contagious 😅 so that can be one challenge. Requires heck of a careful cleaning and strong chemicals for that
5/3/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There you go. Problem solved! 😁
5/3/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. I'm not always able to control myself. And I blame the book for some of the thoughts because it's basically a type of Christian theology and it makes me feel weird about where I am in life
5/3/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. If you are so certain that it's the book then why are you reading it? Why not choose another book shona
5/3/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: It makes me feel like I'm avoiding something that I should not be avoiding
5/3/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: Like I should be thinking theology and Christian living etc. But I don't want to. I don't want back to how I was
5/3/19, 11:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a question for you then. Please can I ask!
5/3/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: Y
5/3/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: E
5/3/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: S
5/3/19, 11:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why do we not talk in the morning
5/3/19, 11:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometimes we come across really important things.
5/3/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: I don't want to talk before the exam
5/3/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: About such things
5/3/19, 11:47 PM - Shona 😍: We can talk after it
5/3/19, 11:47 PM - Shona 😍: Or on Sunday
5/3/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
5/3/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was trying to make a point and you just shot me in the head😂
5/3/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/3/19, 11:47 PM - Shona 😍: :D sorry
5/3/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: What was the point?
5/3/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: Did you mean talking in the morning in general?
5/3/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: Or tomorrow
5/3/19, 11:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes darling🙂
5/3/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: Ah 😁
5/3/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are really misunderstanding me very much these days. I wonder if it's the stress or the distance 🙁
5/3/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: I think it just happens
5/3/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: It happens in life
5/3/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: Misunderstandings
5/3/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's a big deal
5/3/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: Often it's funny
5/3/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.. true that. I was talking about mom about these things today. 😅
5/3/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: Is it not?
5/3/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it sure as hell made me laugh rn
5/3/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: ?
5/3/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I felt a bit annoyed as well. That how can you say such things with such harsh tones. Do you take me as a fool or as child who doesn't know how serious these exams are for you. 🙁
5/3/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok now I am really getting worked up😤
5/3/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: Babyyyy
5/3/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's ok.
5/3/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: I know you know they are important to me. It's just that we have talked in the morning before I was supposed to do one on my own earlier in the spring. Then it was because I was distracted or bothered by something. So I thought it's in the realm of possibilities that you'd suggest it
5/3/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry if I was harsh
5/3/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So my point was that we stopped talking in the mornings because at times things used to come up and we used to get caught up in those topics. So we did the wisest thing. We stopped talking in the morning. Not because we were avoiding those topics but we were keeping them for another time. And then even now. If we look back then we still have a lot of difficult conversations pending but we will certainly talk about them when we have the time. So, when you think that you should be thinking about theology and Christianity etc o think what you are not thinking is that you should think about it later. You don't have to deal with it now, two weeks before the exam
5/3/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know if you meant it but at least that's how I read it
5/3/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/4/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: True... It's just that something about it makes me feel like what the fuck am I even doing here. Thinking it or reading or listening such books. So maybe indeed better to save it for later 😬
5/4/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So logically if I said it wrongly then I guess I am sorry
5/4/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *read it
5/4/19, 12:01 AM - Shona 😍: I just meant it as a statement that it's not something I want. I didn't mean it in a harsh way
5/4/19, 12:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I am remember correctly you mean such statements in a very strict way
5/4/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *can
5/4/19, 12:02 AM - Shona 😍: I don't even know it myself
5/4/19, 12:03 AM - Shona 😍: Can we drop it? Or is there something more about it you'd like to discuss?
5/4/19, 12:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah I realized we are fighting 🙄
5/4/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to start a book with me?
5/4/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: I love you
5/4/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: What book?
5/4/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to tell me about your day?
5/4/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: Not the drug one yet, please 😅
5/4/19, 12:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I live you. I'm sorry I am being an apathetic ass. You are clearly stressed and I am fighting with you. But that makes me want to point it out to you that please as I have said before if you feel anything you can always turn to me and yes you can be mean As well and like rn we can be mean back as well and its ok to fight a little. I guess it keeps us sane. What I mean to say is that I live you too and hey. You are mine.
5/4/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now please don't say that the last sentence freaks you out 😂
5/4/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
5/4/19, 12:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/4/19, 12:10 AM - Shona 😍: ❤❤ Yes we can have disagreements and misunderstandings and arguments and whatnot. They happen. We will move past them. I love you.
5/4/19, 12:10 AM - Shona 😍: Ehm
5/4/19, 12:11 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/4/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/4/19, 12:17 AM - Shona 😍: Seems interesting
5/4/19, 12:18 AM - Shona 😍: This too but it looks like it's out of my comfort zone 😬 so probably would be a good idea for me to read at some point
5/4/19, 12:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. Baby. Baby. Please listen to me. The last time you appeared for an exam you actually got up too early and then you couldn't sleep. Then we discussed that to prevent yourself from overthinking you should be enjoying an animated movie. Please darling if it so happens in the morning please watch one. And in case if you feel you can already tell that you will land in a similar problem then please can you please download the movie rn
5/4/19, 12:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I already have it and I know that it Will be a very interesting read
5/4/19, 12:20 AM - Shona 😍: Also you weren't being apathetic. Quite the opposite darling. And throughout this conversation I've been very calm and quite happy
5/4/19, 12:20 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/4/19, 12:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/4/19, 12:21 AM - Shona 😍: I'll probably get up at my normal wake up time
5/4/19, 12:21 AM - Shona 😍: He freaks me out a bit :D

5/4/19, 12:43 AM - Shona 😍: By the conversation?
5/4/19, 12:43 AM - Shona 😍: Or frustration?
5/4/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/4/19, 12:43 AM - Shona 😍: That you can't come?
5/4/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/4/19, 12:43 AM - Shona 😍: Which part?
5/4/19, 12:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe the fact that I am just too scared to say anything because it's the exam day tomorrow
5/4/19, 12:44 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/4/19, 12:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Especially after this
5/4/19, 12:44 AM - Shona 😍: Darling
5/4/19, 12:45 AM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry I'm such a disaster these days
5/4/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are not. Its just a very bad time to not be able to talk these days
5/4/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am generally very cocky around you
5/4/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Saying whatever I want
5/4/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you respond affectionately
5/4/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But maybe it's the distance that I am counting my steps so carefully
5/4/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: Oh? Is that something that's happened just lately?
5/4/19, 12:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: After yesterday. And today
5/4/19, 12:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About the name calling and of course this
5/4/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: I see
5/4/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I seriously was never going to call you named
5/4/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *names
5/4/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just wanted to mention it
5/4/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I was trying to Tell you how I feel
5/4/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok I get it!
5/4/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I got it!
5/4/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are not maf
5/4/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *mad
5/4/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or unsure about your emotions
5/4/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am not right in my place to say that I feel like calling you named
5/4/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *names
5/4/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd hence my annoyance is ill founded
5/4/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hence I shouldn't have said that I feel like calling you names
5/4/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Anyways I will explain it later
5/4/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Anyways I am very sorry
5/4/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I shouldn't have said that
5/4/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I live you!😍❤❤❤❤
5/4/19, 12:51 AM - Shona 😍: 😳
5/4/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What baby?
5/4/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just had a moment of insight
5/4/19, 12:51 AM - Shona 😍: I'm just confused. Or intrigued.
5/4/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We will talk about it later.
5/4/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't worry
5/4/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
5/4/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For now it's getting late for you and you should sleep
5/4/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: 😳
5/4/19, 12:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Again. What happened?🤣
5/4/19, 12:53 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know if we should continue this conversation now
5/4/19, 12:54 AM - Shona 😍: But this
5/4/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Depends how sleepy are you
5/4/19, 12:55 AM - Shona 😍: I think to me it sounded like you feel like hurting me, because to me it's somehow hurtful. And that's why I was upset
5/4/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: Getting quite sleepy
5/4/19, 12:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I didn't want to hurt you directly but I still wanted to call you names. So I questioned myself rn why else will you say such a thing and that's the truth, I had no other reason but that I wanted to call you names and I think we know each other by now sufficiently enough that you understood implicitly that I feel like saying that and that is why you erupted. And which was totally justified. So I think I am really really sorry that I even thought of mentioning name calling to you. I know it's a bad habit and it will have to go away with time.
5/4/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry baby. I love you
5/4/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night. Please sleep before it goes away.
5/4/19, 1:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I was indirectly hurting you. I am sorry Shona.
5/4/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: I love you kulta.
5/4/19, 1:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think it's a very well written explanation 🙁
5/4/19, 1:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Damn you, you idiot 👉🏻👨🏻‍🦰
5/4/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: I think I got the general idea
5/4/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: Don't call the red headed man an idiot
5/4/19, 1:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby. I'm sleepy as  well
5/4/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: Good night❤

5/4/19, 11:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/4/19, 4:39 PM - Shona 😍: ?
5/4/19, 4:39 PM - Shona 😍: I feel like an idiot
5/4/19, 4:41 PM - Shona 😍: It's like my brain has stopped working altogether
5/4/19, 4:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What happened Shona?
5/4/19, 6:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Spilling copy🤣
5/4/19, 6:48 PM - Shona 😍: ❤❤❤❤❤
5/4/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry that I am behaving like this
5/4/19, 8:23 PM - Shona 😍: Like what??
5/4/19, 8:23 PM - Shona 😍: Baby I don't understand
5/4/19, 8:23 PM - Shona 😍: What are you doing
5/4/19, 8:24 PM - Shona 😍: I've been doing analysis on the past weeks
5/4/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/4/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: ?
5/4/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not talking to you
5/4/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being home
5/4/19, 9:12 PM - Shona 😍: Well you had chores?
5/4/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Finished
5/4/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was super fast and I think I was in my work mode again
5/4/19, 9:13 PM - Shona 😍: That's nice
5/4/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: Why are you apologizing for that I still don't understand
5/4/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: Btw
5/4/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: I had a bit of tequila 🤭
5/4/19, 9:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok?
5/4/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: Just a bit!
5/4/19, 9:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We should definitely talk then.
5/4/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will be able to talk more freely
5/4/19, 9:15 PM - Shona 😍: Just teeeeeny bit
5/4/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then take more. Please
5/4/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want me to drink as well
5/4/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ?
5/4/19, 9:15 PM - Shona 😍: I don't want it to be so that I can only talk when drunk
5/4/19, 9:15 PM - Shona 😍: You don't like alcohol
5/4/19, 9:16 PM - Shona 😍: I found another reason why the past exams felt more difficult
5/4/19, 9:17 PM - Shona 😍: In the previous ones therw have been questions from last year, which has helped me to decide well which questions to do, because I had a good idea how difficult the ones I recognized were
5/4/19, 9:17 PM - Shona 😍: Last week and this week all the questions were new
5/4/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, Shona, I think I should be apologizing, when you make yourself so close to the other person that you can't be irresponsible. I was irresponsible. I watched porn because I thought it's only my life. But no with me now there are two lives attached. When I do such an act it implicitly passes on a message that you placed your trust in a man such as that who is so wreckless. And that can be disturbing. Especially for you who is sooooo cautious with everything that she does. So I should be apologizing. And I beg your forgiveness for being reckless even after winning your trust and in turn acting like you never expect me to.
5/4/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok! That's so nice!
5/4/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I still would want to get drunk with you. I can quickly gulp some.
5/4/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: Baby. I understand that it's been really hard for you. It's been an addiction for you and those habits die hard. Yes it affects me too. But life is not all sunshine and rainbows and I've chosen to be with you. And you've brought so much good in my life.
5/4/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not exactly drunk
5/4/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: It was maybe as much as one shotglass
5/4/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: I mixed it with soda
5/4/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
5/4/19, 9:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not say it again
5/4/19, 9:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's your choice
5/4/19, 9:26 PM - Shona 😍: Yas
5/4/19, 9:26 PM - Shona 😍: I don't really feel like having morw
5/4/19, 9:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't mean it in a bad way
5/4/19, 9:26 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't take it in a bad way
5/4/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good
5/4/19, 9:30 PM - Shona 😍: I actually analyzed our conversations
5/4/19, 9:30 PM - Shona 😍: Over a week or so
5/4/19, 9:30 PM - Shona 😍: Wow we text a lot
5/4/19, 9:31 PM - Shona 😍: I couldn't figure out any one reason for what's been going on
5/4/19, 9:32 PM - Shona 😍: But something that I recognized was that many times I've been wondering where we are headed, the two of us
5/4/19, 9:33 PM - Shona 😍: There have been several instances when I've been thinking if this is it for us
5/4/19, 9:33 PM - Shona 😍: And then we've worked through it
5/4/19, 9:33 PM - Shona 😍: But having it come up so often
5/4/19, 9:33 PM - Shona 😍: It takes a toll
5/4/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand
5/4/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I realized it yesterday
5/4/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That we have been fighting a lot
5/4/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But we have to take into account the period of the year
5/4/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
5/4/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's less than two weeks to your exams and I had the project on my head.
5/4/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: And we've been apart for a very long time already
5/4/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So. ......
5/4/19, 9:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. And on top of it, we haven't had one deep loving conversation in over two weeks. We are just relying on the strength of our bonds from the past. and since we have been so close in the past that it has survived this test but I think it's the final showdown and it's not a mere survival game now. I remember you being able to focus better when you felt close and loved. So I think I will have to find a way to talk to you everyday no matter what.
5/4/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: Also, it still is my very first relationship and I realized that I still feel like I'm a very self centered person. And I don't really like that. Over the years it's been difficult to find boundaries with people and I've just built these crazy walls and tried to keep everyone out because it's felt too much to deal with other people. But the walls have isolated me too
5/4/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I tell you something
5/4/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And take this like a statement that I am saying while I am pointing a finger at you and staring straight into your eyes.
5/4/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe it is so. I feel very close when we talk and more whole somehow
5/4/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I WILL BREAK THOSE FUCKING WALLS DOWN!
5/4/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: You already have done a lot of that ❤ and for that I can't tell how grateful I am
5/4/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ~maybe~
5/4/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ~maybe~
5/4/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know you better than you do
5/4/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: Okay then
5/4/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: I did realize that on the night before the exam that went really well, we talked more and on video call for a good while before we slept. Probably that's just one factor but it definitely is a factor. What you said is very true.
5/4/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: Btw. Do you already have this book?
5/4/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/4/19, 10:02 PM - Shona 😍: Oh
5/4/19, 10:02 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
5/4/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call?
5/4/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry baby
5/4/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am on another call
5/4/19, 10:27 PM - Shona 😍: 😶
5/4/19, 10:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You pissed?😅
5/4/19, 10:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please keep talking
5/4/19, 10:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel very close.
5/4/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just want to keep talking and not stop ever
5/4/19, 10:54 PM - Shona 😍: :)
5/4/19, 10:54 PM - Shona 😍: While you're crapping?
5/4/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On text idiot
5/4/19, 10:55 PM - Shona 😍: I know
5/4/19, 10:55 PM - Shona 😍: I think it's funny
5/4/19, 10:55 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't mean it in a negative way
5/4/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would have video called it's just that mom is in the next room and she can listen
5/4/19, 10:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course I know🤣

5/4/19, 10:57 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm okay also off you
5/4/19, 10:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Uuuuuh
5/4/19, 10:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We should not be talking about sex. We have a lot of other important topics. 😅
5/4/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
5/4/19, 10:59 PM - Shona 😍: Well sex is one of the topics though
5/4/19, 11:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to send you nudes
5/4/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: Uuuuh
5/4/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: I'd really like to bite you in places
5/4/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: But are we seriously getting on a side track
5/4/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can't you leave the dildo inside?
5/4/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: While wearing the lower?
5/4/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: It's kinda bloody everywhere atm

5/5/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/5/19, 1:04 AM - Shona 😍: On purpose?
5/5/19, 1:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I forgot for the first two days and then I just wanted to see how long can I go. I have been questioning myself, was it really just the project or  about the internship?
5/5/19, 1:05 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe both?
5/5/19, 1:05 AM - Shona 😍: And are you not taking any meds atm?
5/5/19, 1:05 AM - Shona 😍: And can you actually tell the difference so soon
5/5/19, 1:06 AM - Shona 😍: With the meds I mean

5/5/19, 1:07 AM - Shona 😍: I'm just wondering, I don't know how it works
5/5/19, 1:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nope
5/5/19, 1:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That did cross my mind.
5/5/19, 1:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well. I will see my psychiatrist this Friday and I will talk to him.

5/5/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know what I think about sometimes that one day in our house we will take the whole day off and then just roam around naked. No clothes at all and then we will fuck in different spots and then fuck as many times we want. Anyone can initiate the sex and do whatever they want. I know I am up for it I wasn't sure how you will like it but I will still like to jerk off on your naked butt while you are cooking 😗

5/5/19, 1:42 AM - Shona 😍: I think no harm in asking but I might not do it if I'm not in the mood. If I am then I will
5/5/19, 1:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes! That I will of course always respect. 🙂
5/5/19, 1:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would like you to sit on my face rn

5/5/19, 1:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I hug you tighter
5/5/19, 1:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then rub you against my chest
5/5/19, 1:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: While we are hugging and I am feeling your boobs
5/5/19, 1:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slowly slide my hand behind your back
5/5/19, 1:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd grab your ass
5/5/19, 1:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both hands on both cheeks

5/5/19, 3:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am a man who speaks a lot, you obviously know that. But when I talk to you,  I want you to understand and remember every word of what I say and with all the cultural differences and the accent differences and then the idiological idiosyncrasies, I really have to choose my words very carefully and craft my every message very patiently and that makes our conversations very very interesting. It's like I am always in the state of flow during our conversations
5/5/19, 3:06 AM - Shona 😍: That is special ❤
5/5/19, 3:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And its like we perfectly compliment each other.

And you know how he has always been this father figure for me right so he was telling me how proud he is and how hopeful he was all these years that God will do justice with us someday. He told us how happy he is about my pay and the internship.

5/5/19, 1:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really feel like telling you about two things but 🙁
5/5/19, 1:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can't type
5/5/19, 1:18 PM - Shona 😍: Audio note?
5/5/19, 1:18 PM - Shona 😍: I heard most of what you said
5/5/19, 1:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/5/19, 1:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Say something please
5/5/19, 1:34 PM - Shona 😍: Interesting way to look at it
5/5/19, 1:35 PM - Shona 😍: I think there's some truth or value to the idea
5/5/19, 1:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I forgot to tell you, I went shopping the two days ago, got myself a pair of sandals and formal shoes
5/5/19, 1:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really like it. I am sure if you give it time you will like it too
5/5/19, 1:38 PM - Shona 😍: I mean I think it's one way to try to conceptualize it to oneself
5/5/19, 1:38 PM - Shona 😍: Ohhhh!!
5/5/19, 1:38 PM - Shona 😍: Coool
5/5/19, 1:38 PM - Shona 😍: Please show me when you have them with you

5/5/19, 1:40 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂
5/5/19, 1:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thank god you find it funny
5/5/19, 1:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For a second I thought what if you didn't
5/5/19, 1:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It would have been one hell of a mesd
5/5/19, 1:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *mess
5/5/19, 1:40 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah, finally I do :D
5/5/19, 1:40 PM - Shona 😍: 😁😁😁

5/5/19, 1:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We really are finding our groove together
5/5/19, 1:41 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too rakas
5/5/19, 1:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now we just need a cat a dog and a cuckoo
5/5/19, 1:41 PM - Shona 😍: ❤
5/5/19, 1:41 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmm still not sure about the cat
5/5/19, 1:41 PM - Shona 😍: Or cuckoo
5/5/19, 1:42 PM - Shona 😍: Or dog 😂
5/5/19, 1:42 PM - Shona 😍: But sure
5/5/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why? Did all the cat videos not convince you 😅
5/5/19, 1:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love Lulu in those videos. She is so adorable
5/5/19, 1:43 PM - Shona 😍: No... I'm almost afraid to admit it but I found them a bit boring and I couldn't watch them for long😅
5/5/19, 1:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh?
5/5/19, 1:43 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I'm just a dog person all the way
5/5/19, 1:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I would want a cat at some point
5/5/19, 1:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok maybe in next life then 😒
5/5/19, 1:44 PM - Shona 😍: Though I did like my cousin's cat when I was young!
5/5/19, 1:44 PM - Shona 😍: I used to call him, yes _him_ , Cleopatra😂
5/5/19, 1:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
5/5/19, 1:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Great. So we have a name as well. We just need to find a cat.
5/5/19, 1:45 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
5/5/19, 1:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am so tall and these buses were not made for tall people
5/5/19, 1:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My knees are touching the seat in front
5/5/19, 1:46 PM - Shona 😍: Oh no
5/5/19, 1:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For almost 2 hours now
5/5/19, 1:46 PM - Shona 😍: I feel you
5/5/19, 1:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's something I also liked about Finland. It's a tall people's nation
5/5/19, 1:47 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah taller than India
5/5/19, 1:48 PM - Shona 😍: But we should really move to the Netherlands, Germany or Croatia
5/5/19, 1:48 PM - Shona 😍: That's where the really tall people are at 😬
5/5/19, 1:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I was just contemplating about the contrast yesterday. From the most polluted city in the world to the most environmentally  clean country in the world. What a dick move 🤣
5/5/19, 1:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's
5/5/19, 1:49 PM - Shona 😍: :D
5/5/19, 1:49 PM - Shona 😍: Smart move I'd say
5/5/19, 1:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's move to Netherlands. The countries national color is orange. How awesome is that! Also, I don't associate Netherlanders to be hot and all so no problem of finding anyone sexier than you. Can't say the same about Croatia Japan or Korea.
5/5/19, 1:50 PM - Shona 😍: Okay and now you can go fuck yourself 😂
5/5/19, 1:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/5/19, 1:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know, how did I even grow the balls to say that🤣
5/5/19, 1:52 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm well Croatian men are really hot too so maybe we should stay away indeed
5/5/19, 1:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yes, Poland and Czech Republic
5/5/19, 1:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See. We should be rational about such things
5/5/19, 1:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you serious?
5/5/19, 1:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean can you send me some pictures!
5/5/19, 1:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you remember the scene in which Monica asked Chandler if he is afraid of her?
5/5/19, 2:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/6HfEAed9hKM
5/5/19, 2:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/5/19, 2:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You mad at me?
5/5/19, 2:25 PM - Shona 😍: Was not a good time to hit me with a low blow
5/5/19, 2:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was it a low blow?
5/5/19, 2:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just meant in a very matter of factly way
5/5/19, 2:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry darling. What according to you is low about it?
5/5/19, 2:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please talk to me.
5/5/19, 2:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It can only be solved if we talk. There is clearly a misunderstanding. I didn't mean any harm so I am sure we can get to the root of the emotion and clear the fog
5/5/19, 2:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby? Video call?
5/5/19, 2:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
5/5/19, 2:33 PM - Shona 😍: Just a sec
5/5/19, 2:34 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not sure what I need to censor
5/5/19, 2:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to censor at all
5/5/19, 2:35 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think all the nastiness needs to be said
5/5/19, 2:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It can be said? If you have already bewared me then I promise I won't take it personally
5/5/19, 2:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is like saying I am going to make an order in the place of a request and please don't mind.
5/5/19, 2:36 PM - Shona 😍: Well. What you said made me want to say why don't you god damn it leave me alone already then if that's what you're after in life. So it hit close to the sensitive spots, related to the past few weeks' issues I guess
5/5/19, 2:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well you do have a point, why would I say such a thing， do I plan to cheat on you? What's the point of finding someone sexy? Am I going to pursue them? And if the answer is yes then why don't I just leave you already. But the fact is that there is indeed a mid way and it is a very shitty truth. The fact is that even if I am in a relationship I can find a race/cast/religion/ethnicity/breed of people sexy and that's a part of me being human but knowing me from the past, I think when I do feel that, I feel guilty that why am I feeling about it this way when I already have you. To me even think about it feels like I am cheating on you and gives me immense guilt. Of the kind that makes me stressed then impulsive and hence reckless and then I give in to my bad habits like watching porn. Now if I know that something will have that kind of an effect on me then can I not- and, should I not- just openly confess it infront of you discuss it freely and then should we not just avoid such encounters?
5/5/19, 2:48 PM - Shona 😍: No we shouldn't avoid the conversations. But one thing I asked was that we discuss the difficult stuff after the exam. And it's like these things keep coming up all the time. Today I've already been thinking about options of med schools in Estonia and Latvia because I've felt so worried.
5/5/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry, I didn't mean to touch upon that topic on purpose. But I will be more careful next time. But I think there is nothing more to say. I just feel very guilty about these things and that's it. Other than that all the messages about Croatia and Japan and whatnot were said on a very lighter tone. I don't want to live elsewhere other than Finland with you. And I think it-the other choices- was a joke and a joke only.
5/5/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Call me Shona please
5/5/19, 3:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know bossing around when someone feels down is not the way. You just cant scold your way out of negative distortions but again what I want you to do is sit and analyze yourself the reality. Not the negative reality that you are conjuring but the true reality that is out there. Taking into account the _positives_ and the negatives. If you want I can help you think. I can debate with you nd discuss with you but please you are not going to go back in your shell and feel down. You just can't do that. I forbid you. (that's right I am telling you what to do. You want to feel bad about it, go ahead and do that, but I think I have my own share of say in your life and I _am_ going to exercise that right, right now!)
5/5/19, 3:17 PM - Shona 😍: You are right. Also, in this matter I actually like it that you tell me what to do 😬
5/5/19, 3:19 PM - Shona 😍: And something more to add to this. I thought it's also a question of preferences. What I thought was that plenty of people find me sexy, if you don't appreciate it then leave me alone and go be with someone else, and I can be with someone who does appreciate me for what I am.
5/5/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On a side note who are these plenty people and can you please steer clear of them 😅
5/5/19, 4:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is that how I make you feel? Inadequate? Have I not told you how much I appreciate your beauty? Was yesterday not a testimony of how damn attracted I am to you? And if that wasn't sufficient then my question to you is what is? And my question is a serious one. Do I really make you feel inadequate? Because that's a recurring problem in my relationships, Voldemort faced it and she was quite averse of it. And so did others. I don't know why that happens maybe I need to analyze it. Maybe its a girl thing that you guys are more sensitive to appreciations not directed to you. Maybe it is me who says it very frequently. I don't know. Will have to see. Would love to improve upon that but again my question to you my darling also is that, do you really feel unadmired unappreciated and unwanted. Do my actions and words not suggest how crucial you are in my life? And is that it, are my words the only marker? My tears? My emotions? My reactions? All these countless memories? All the time invested? All the characters typed? All the mental abilities used? Do they not speak for themselves. And if they don't then please come to me right now and carve out a hole in my chest because I don't have a use of this heart who beats only for you. I would rather bear a hole in my bosom than bear your name branded on it, beating in futility and still not resonating with my beloved
5/5/19, 4:45 PM - Shona 😍: Rakas. That is a very good and important question indeed. I think this calls for some introspection on my part too. The vast majority of your actions and words are very loving, and I feel very much appreciated by you. All the time and energy that you put into this relationship and how much of yourself you give. So I'm not exactly sure why it then is a sensitive matter when it comes to such things like today. I can only say for myself, but I could imagine that it might be a more common thing among women. Because I think on the societal level, at least in the west, it is still the case that women seem to be more often appreciated based on their looks and appearance than men, instead of their skill and ability to do things. I mean I think that's still a cultural message that is given to us, although I think it slowly changing, at least to some extent. And for me personally it has to do with my past, me evaluating myself based on my appearance, like I've told you. It is not something that will go away quickly, apparently it takes years. And maybe to some extent it will stay with me always. But I'm hopeful that it will matter to me less and less over time, and when I get more confidence from the things I do or how I am as a person. It is already so much better than it has been before.
5/5/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you. Please come here.
5/5/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me hug you. 🤗
5/5/19, 4:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love every side of you and every part of you.

5/5/19, 4:47 PM - Shona 😍: Kulta. I love you too.
5/5/19, 4:51 PM - Shona 😍: Very much.

5/5/19, 4:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am very very agitated rn and  I would really appreciate it if you can talk
5/5/19, 4:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Audio call

5/5/19, 5:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona how much are you paying for each book??
5/5/19, 5:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On audible?
5/5/19, 5:42 PM - Shona 😍: Uhhh... One credit is around 15 dollars
5/5/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: Of course Shona. I really like it when you share such things with me.
5/5/19, 6:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. That's costly.
5/5/19, 6:12 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
5/5/19, 6:13 PM - Shona 😍: I've done the book swap couple times though
5/5/19, 6:14 PM - Shona 😍: So that if I really don't like the book I can get another one
5/5/19, 6:14 PM - Shona 😍: That's really good
5/5/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/5/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The Availability bias: People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory
5/5/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would please just look at that :'(
5/5/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Look at the beauty of the statement!!!
5/5/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How elegantly it has been put forth.
5/5/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Take my life God. For I have lived. I feel so complete. I have you in my life. I have a partner so able with whom I can discuss these things. I live you darling. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. Life is soooo good. It has you in it and a book so good.
5/5/19, 6:50 PM - Shona 😍: That is quite a finding
5/5/19, 6:53 PM - Shona 😍: I was just thinking how great it is to have a partner who introduces such things to me ❤ That can challenge my own thinking and I actually learn new things. This is something I didn't even know to wish for beforehand
5/5/19, 8:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey bestie
5/5/19, 8:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is it going

5/5/19, 9:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No one does and yet it is so good to have someone like that
5/5/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: Huuuhhuh

5/5/19, 9:55 PM - Shona 😍: But it's a bit tricky to listen to it while doing something else, I found my focus wander to other things repeatedly
5/5/19, 9:55 PM - Shona 😍: Very interesting
5/5/19, 9:56 PM - Shona 😍: I just feel it would require all the attention
5/5/19, 9:57 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I'm still laughing about this, I'm gonna have to ask what did you mean by this? I have several options in mind

5/5/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤❤❤
5/5/19, 10:18 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. This is interesting. My sexuality is part of the person that I am though.
5/5/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: I can easily finish myself though, it's not about that
5/5/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: But is that really how you feel that those are somehow conflicting?
5/5/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
5/5/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: What about that?
5/5/19, 10:22 PM - Shona 😍: Because that makes it sound like you don't respect the sexual part in me
5/5/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤨
5/5/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Where do you even conjure these things🤣
5/5/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. When did I say that?
5/5/19, 10:39 PM - Shona 😍: Well you just did. You said you were having bestie vibes. You wouldn't want to have sex with me, because you respect me? You're the one who said I'm trying to understand what on earth do you mean by it. Can you explain it to me what you meant by those words then if not that
5/5/19, 10:40 PM - Shona 😍: You could've just said you're not in the mood
5/5/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I have always been ambiguous or maybe it is something wrong with me rn. Anyways I will try and explain
5/5/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What I meant is, that I feel very close to you, I feel like a best friend to you and I want to do something special, I want to do something nice, I know sex is also nice. But I know you like to be respected more for the person that you are apart from your looks and sex and hence I wanted to talk to you about other stuff. However I was still ready for phone sex if you were. And I never distanced it in my head from the fact that you are my bestie or my gf or whether it is in conflict with any opinions or beliefs that I hold about you.
5/5/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/5/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/5/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's it?
5/5/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: Well if that's what you thought I think I understand
5/5/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can see you are not in a good mood.
5/5/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: I am in a good mood
5/5/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: Why do you think I'm not?
5/5/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Okay then. My bad.
5/5/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing
5/5/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I'm just getting so used to these misunderstandings that I didn't even get worked up about this
5/5/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: Like okay, something came up again, fine, let's figure out what it is
5/5/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: I did also wonder if this is  gonna end some day
5/5/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: The misunderstandings
5/5/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe not
5/5/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: But not being able to hear the tone abd see the expression makes it harder
5/5/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: So it will get better
5/5/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think the tone is the problem
5/5/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I also don't think I have had so many misunderstandings in other relationships
5/5/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe if I did start having them then I ended the relationship
5/5/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: Well we also have the cultural gap
5/5/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously, I don't think it is, the problem is you, and again I am not saying this to piss you off, and if you love me that you should understand that I would never do that but ma'am the problem is that you take everything too literally and you take it as if I mean everything in the worst way. For eg, in the afternoon, I never said that said that I don't find you sexy or that I am going to leave you for others but that's what you understood from what I wrote. I am not saying I put it forth very succintly or that what I wrote was clear in its meaning and intent but you then again out of the thousand different things you could have interpreted you chose the best two. Despite the obvious facts that pointed otherwise, like us from yesterday should have said to you that I find you sexy but that didn't occur to you. Or the fact that I love you so much and that I will probably would not have survived February if not for your support hence I will never leave you,  never occurred to you. You just thought that he may leave me and he will not find me sexy. Its like whenever there is a misunderstanding it feels like that is the first time we are talking and you don't know me at all and that we have just met and there is absolutely no history, memories, past to learn from or ponder upon. 
And hey, again, you may feel like why is he behaving that way, is he saying that it's entirely my fault, is he saying that I am broken? Does he want to break up with me? Is he actually doing this on a Sunday night when he knows I have to study Monday morning and this may distract me? Does he not know I have the exam next week? 

BUT, the matter of fact is that I took into account all that and I took my best intuitive guess as to what's the right thing to do. No I am not leaving you and I still love you. I love you enough to understand that it's not broken and it's not you and that it's the exam stress showing up in the form of negative distortions and hence the misunderstandings and hence I know that I will not judge you based on these instances and these days. You can do what you want to!
5/5/19, 11:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think it's only that
5/5/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Great! That at least solves the problem for one of us.
5/5/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: I am very sorry.
5/5/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know Hanna. If anything the way you have been acting is disrespectful to me and my feelings. If you don't want to be with me you can just simply say that. 



That's what I actually want to say. But am I saying it????!!!?! No! You know why? Because I fucking understand that it's not you. It's the exam!!!!! But you know what! It will help if you understand if yourself a bit and the next time you have a negative thought then introspect a bit!
5/5/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: You are right, I have a tendency to do that. Having listened to the book I think that is just the autopilot for me, the negative distortions. And when I'm really tired and stressed, I don't have it in me to do the slow thinking and rationalizing. I don't like that habit of mine one bit.
5/5/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know darling. 😫 
I know😭
I love you. Do I not? Have I not loved you enough and thought with you enough to change that already? Have  I not been supportive enough? Caring enough? Why baby? Tell me why it still is the way that you behave like that with me?
5/5/19, 11:44 PM - Shona 😍: I'm glad you said it now. So that I know how you really feel
5/5/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are doing it again. Focusing on the first part when you should be reading the second. 🙁
5/5/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: No but I am glad! Because it helps me to understand
5/5/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
5/5/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry for the outburst
5/5/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was holding it in for a while now.
5/5/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: I somehow feel this is the root of all my problems. Do you remember in January and February I was talking about wanting to go to therapy? This is why. I know myself from a very long time and at times I just feel completely helpless that I haven't been able to change it yet
5/5/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: It is good that you let it out
5/5/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/5/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Stop reading everything!
5/5/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Read this first.
5/5/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
5/5/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I beg you.
5/5/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is the best thing you can do to yourself
5/5/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to read it myself
5/5/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I can read it with you
5/5/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/5/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please find a link online so that I can buy it for you
5/5/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to gift it to you
5/5/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the perfect birthday gift
5/5/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: Babu
5/5/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😊😗🙂🤭😄😍🙃
5/5/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you know how to melt my heart you cheater!🥰
5/5/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All that anger and that one word😚
5/5/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: That was the only word I could think of. I feel ashamed of what I've done. I feel like sitting at your feet.
5/5/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you know what I will do after that
5/6/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will sit down there with you. And I know you are crying. I will crawl upto you and hug you. I will drink your tears and tickle your neck with my nose. I know you will get annoyed and push me away so then I will climb on to your lap and fall on you. I know you will still want to cry so I will sit on you tie down your hands and kiss your forehead. I will the pick you up and make you sit on my lap and I will hug you until you become quiet and then I will kiss you my love. Because that is what you are worthy of, not my feet.
5/6/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hanna. You are mine and I don't expect you to be fine. I am so broken myself in so many ways that you seem much better. Just promise me that for the next few days you will slow down before reaching for  anymore negative conclusions
5/6/19, 12:05 AM - Shona 😍: I will try my very best.
5/6/19, 12:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On a lighter note, it may not be a sex story but did it do anything for you? 😅
5/6/19, 12:07 AM - Shona 😍: How, how did I get so lucky to find you
5/6/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh you didn't get lucky, you paid the price. 330€ to be exact :p
5/6/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: 😁
5/6/19, 12:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Come on. Show me that smile now.
5/6/19, 12:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes! Thats it!
5/6/19, 12:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🥺🙃
5/6/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: So it was just a very, very good purchase
5/6/19, 12:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well you got yourself a boy in the Lacy panties 😆
5/6/19, 12:09 AM - Shona 😍: :)
5/6/19, 12:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now tell me that you love me you jackass and that you feel much better😗
5/6/19, 12:10 AM - Shona 😍: I love you so much rakkaimpani and I feel much better and more hopeful ❤
5/6/19, 12:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And by do anything, I meant, did you at least enjoy (enjoy means finding cute in this case) reading it
5/6/19, 12:11 AM - Shona 😍: I did ❤ it was the sweetest thing I've heard in I don't know how long
5/6/19, 12:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do yourself a favor. Take a marker and write that down that you will not think negatively in the next 10 days. Write that on a piece of paper and post it in your room and send me a picture
5/6/19, 12:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well not very long. Because in the afternoon you heard about the boy in the Lacy panties. _that_ was the sweetest thing 😅
5/6/19, 12:14 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm I think it works better in a statement of what I will do, instead of writing what I shouldn't do. Like I will cultivate positive thoughts. You know, forbidding stuff often makes you focus on it more
5/6/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know what hurts more: my head from all the fighting; my hands from all the typing; or my heart to see you this way
5/6/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok then in your intent for the day for the next ten days please at least think about it
5/6/19, 12:14 AM - Shona 😍: No, to me it was the other one :)
5/6/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: 🖤
5/6/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
5/6/19, 12:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well being a romantic the answer should be the third one, being a human it should be the second one, and being a fedup man of his wife on periods it should definitely be the first one.
5/6/19, 12:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now again, by calling you my wife I am not asking you to marry me but I think I have the liberty of calling you that. *you can still deny my proposal when the time comes.* I won't mind.!
5/6/19, 12:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Maybe that was unnecessary.
5/6/19, 12:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok Kunj. Stop typing. Your hands are already hurting 😂😂🤣😆
5/6/19, 12:18 AM - Shona 😍: 🤗😚🤗😚🤗
5/6/19, 12:18 AM - Shona 😍: I'm just amazed
5/6/19, 12:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know, me too, how can a man type so much 😆
5/6/19, 12:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The power of Habit I guess 😝
5/6/19, 12:19 AM - Shona 😍: 😬
5/6/19, 12:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But what about?
5/6/19, 12:19 AM - Shona 😍: About you
5/6/19, 12:21 AM - Shona 😍: You keep saying you're not a patient man but quite the opposite is true. You are immensely patient.
5/6/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. As much as I want to talk. Maasi is scolding me for texting at this hour.  Let's talk tomorrow
 I love you. 
Good night. 
You have plenty to say. So text. I will be glad to wake up to some of your late night thoughts.
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Shona 😍: Good night rakas ❤
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Shona 😍: I love you
5/6/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: I still think about the therapy. Even if I want to change and even with the help of the book and doing it with you, I'm not sure if it can happen that way. Or even if it can, I think it will take a long time. I have been building those habits for 23 years soon. However I am more hopeful already after reading the Power of habit. It gives me hope that I can indeed change my twisted ways. But what I'm still considering is that should I get professional help too, if I can. I think it might be too much for only you to bear. I absolutely hate it that you have to suffer because of it.
5/6/19, 1:33 AM - Shona 😍: And I'm actually scared of what it might do to you and us. There are some burdens from my family history too, I think. And having grown up with them I don't even know what all I carry with me. Something that came to my mind now is my late aunt, dad's big sister. She actually tried to commit suicide in her sixties, I think it was around 10 years ago. She was hospitalized and she survived that. We never talked much about that in my family. I don't remember us even having a proper conversation about it. Maybe we did and I just don't remember. But I still don't remember or understand what had happened with her. The one thing I remember around that event was that I saw dad crying one day, and it was obvious it was because of that. I hugged him for a while, but I didn't know what else to do, and I don't think what else could have I done. I didn't even know what had happened. After that event my aunt's son (my cousin) cut pretty much all communication with my aunt and us other relatives too. He didn't even come to my grandma's funeral, nor to his own mother's memorial. My aunt got very sick in the end, I've understood it had to do with the cancer she'd had. And when she felt that her death is near, she invited us to her own "memorial", which was us, her closest family having one last evening and dinner together. She didn't want a proper funeral, that was the funeral to her. She passed away some months after that.
There are many other things from my family from dad's side that I don't really know very well. I've understood that my oldest cousin was badly addicted to drugs at some point, and he lost his sight in some kind of an accident, possibly related to those drug circles. He has also passed away, several years ago. I didn't know him really, we only met a couple times in some family celebrations.
These are just couple examples of the hurts from my dad's side of family. I'm not quite sure why I started to talk about these things. Maybe because I don't know what all is there, and we have buried a lot of stuff that we haven't talked about. Or that was not told to me at least. I don't think Mikko knows any more than me, Laura might know more. And probably if I now asked, my parents would tell me more. But not talking enough is something that I've learned from my family. I would really like to change that for myself and I don't want that to burden our relationship.
5/6/19, 6:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning. To start off your day, I thought of something that I think is really funny and you might like 😄 

So, maasi is a typical introvert. I told you right? So, I woke up and I say, "Maasi, good morning" aaaaand, she doesn't reply. I knew it could happen so I didn't mind. But then I asked her how did she sleep and she didnt say again. Now someday, I am not saying it is a certainty but I can imagine someday it might be the case that you do the same and don't reply and in that case I was thinking I will slap you. 😂
Don't misunderstand me, please, hear me out. 🙏🏻😄
She was not facing me and I her back was towards me and then for an instant I thought, if it were you in her place I would have slapped you on your year. The slap itself will not be hurtful but instead it will be forceful. I mean it will not slam your cheek but I will actually push you down so that you are down on the bed again and then I will climb on you and slap you with my leg. 
Again, don't take these words literally. They are meant in a very benign way. Like the video I sent you?

I actually smiled in my bed first thing in the morning when I thought of it. And that is something that I really admire about you. You make me smile like I didn't used to. I smile because of you in general and at times just by the thought of you. I love you Shona. Two tight slaps. 🤣
5/6/19, 6:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *ear
5/6/19, 9:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message
5/6/19, 9:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: First of all darling, talking is not burdening, I will quote a very recent example, we have been talking for almost an year now. Do you think you are burdened of our conversations? Do you feel tired of talking to me? Do you feel like the nature of our conversations is on the boring side or that it bogs you down any which way? No Shona. That is not the case perhaps and my point to you is that it never will be. You know why? Because where there is love and affection for the other. There is care and the other person derives pleasure from looking after the other person. For eg in our case. I was in a terrible terrible condition in February. But did that deter you from talking to me? Did that depress you? Or did it burden you?  I know it didn't because what better way to live your life other than to the service of your loved one. I don't know if that's your philosophy. Although, I choose to believe that it is. All I know is, that it definitely is mine and I will always and always cherish taking care of you. And that is why no matter how long it takes but I am willing to invest myself in you and in helping you get rid of these habits. 
As much as I want you to see a therapist, I know it can be costly and I know it can be frustrating to find a good therapist so I insist that we will have to take the matter in our hands and then do something about it. You will have to trust me that the book will have to be our starting point as it is the only way we can get some good therapy. It also introduces us to the general know how of such sessions and ways and hence makes us more able to take decisions when it comes to choosing a therapist or finding a cure. 
On that same note, I also feel that we all are flawed. No one can be perfect. You still are a gem of a soul. Things like these are very petty and are a result of our perfectionist attitude so don't stress about it. Even if it doesn't go away it still is a very very teeny tiny problem and nothing to be worried about. You are still a functional person and that you will be all your life. This no complain attitude is just a good one to have. 
Call me rn if you can. I would like to see you and I am sure you will like to see me too. 
Also, if I know you well then I am sure you didn't invite anyone to see the play today. If that is the case, please stress on it and invite everyone. I know it's a little intimidating for you but please believe me, you will feel good afterwards. So please call em to the play. If you don't then I will. :p
And hey, I am sorry to hear that what your aunt went through but let's put a pin on that. I think there is a lot more to be said on it and I guess we will have to speak about it on some other day. I am looking forward to it though.
Also, today is a fresh day and a fresh week. I hope you were thorough in your intent for the day that you are not going to have a negative attitude.  There is an unsaid rule in street brawls. Whosever lands the first blow is the real winner. It may sound counter intuitive but it has its own logic to it and I really like that logic. So the point is that by saying such a thing what you essentially do is that you entice the fighters to just get into the fight. Nobody waits for it to start, they just go at it. So as opposed to a cold fight it turns into a hot soup. And that keeps the spirit of the fight alive. However, there is another very good reason, by saying that you have to deliver the first blow, you know you are inviting death itself and once in there is no way out so you try and really go for it, you be mean and you make it is your best shot so that the other person is thrown off balance. 
Now the question is why am I telling you all this. And the reason is that these studies of yours have been taking you over for the past two weeks and pinning you down and I don't fucking like it at all. So do whatever you want, suck it up, get on your feet and you fucking take those damn hours down today. You go out there and land the heftiest punch in the first hour of studying itself. So hard that they(the topics) can never look you in the face and you never lose focus. Remember, you are a human and no inanimate object is better than you. And you are the best human that I know. So you have got something in you that makes me go wow. So find that wow factor and kill it girl. Kill em all. I know you believe in me and that I was born to do wonders. Even I believe that. But you know what I also believe in? It's you. Imagine if I am the prospective successful man you think I am and you are the person that I draw my motivation from then, then, then, theeeen, what does that make you!!
5/6/19, 9:47 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
5/6/19, 9:48 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know where to start :D

5/6/19, 10:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like I pissed you off. Is it so?
5/6/19, 10:35 AM - Shona 😍: No. You told me to get out of my comfort zone by asking people to come to the play, and that's exactly how it feels, uncomfortable, as it is outside the zone 😬
5/6/19, 10:36 AM - Shona 😍: And if you piss me off, I don't send these
5/6/19, 10:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah right.
5/6/19, 10:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should I not have done that?
5/6/19, 10:42 AM - Shona 😍: Do you mean that really or in a sarcastic way?
5/6/19, 10:42 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know
5/6/19, 10:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No baby!
5/6/19, 10:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not at all.
5/6/19, 10:43 AM - Shona 😍: In general it's good to have someone to do that
5/6/19, 10:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel that too. But you felt really uncomfortable and I could see that
5/6/19, 10:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just love you too much maybe that's the problem
5/6/19, 10:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are like my spoilt child.
5/6/19, 10:44 AM - Shona 😍: It was an either or question, you still didn't answer 😂
5/6/19, 10:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Who won't play with others because she is too loved at home 😄
5/6/19, 10:44 AM - Shona 😍: 😂
5/6/19, 10:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't mean it in a sarcastic way
5/6/19, 10:44 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/6/19, 10:45 AM - Shona 😍: Yikes that's not good
5/6/19, 10:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that tells me how not to raise kids. 😁
5/6/19, 10:45 AM - Shona 😍: Exactly 😬😅
5/6/19, 10:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well, you can still make ammends. It's take a lot of courage to be a change. And I know you can be one. You always keep saying how the family seems apart and you don't feel close to everyone. You want to change that? Now is the chance. I can write a long message for you if you want but that will be in English.
5/6/19, 10:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Write a wholesome warm and insisting invitation to everyone. Inviting them personally. Let them behave the way they want. You do your part. At least you will feel satiated that you tried.
5/6/19, 10:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if someone is busy we understand
5/6/19, 10:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If someone is uninterested we understand but we can't just presume things and not try
5/6/19, 10:55 AM - Shona 😍: Eääääähm
5/6/19, 10:56 AM - Shona 😍: You are right but I don't want to hear it today 😳
5/6/19, 10:56 AM - Shona 😍: .
5/6/19, 10:57 AM - Shona 😍: I feel like I should've asked beforehand
5/6/19, 10:58 AM - Shona 😍: Fine
5/6/19, 10:58 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe I'll do it
5/6/19, 11:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As you wish Shona. I think beyond this point you will get distracted and uncomfortable which I certainly don't want.
5/6/19, 11:41 AM - Shona 😍: I did it
5/6/19, 11:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Atta girl!
5/6/19, 11:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am so proud of you.
5/6/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/6/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/6/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You make me fall in love with you each day.
5/6/19, 11:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You really are a kulta(hindi meaning)
5/6/19, 11:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now I can understand that you have used enough reservoirs of comfort and ease in this exercise
5/6/19, 11:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I plan to not disturb you and let you study in peace
5/6/19, 11:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not message you on my own while you are studying however _you_ can
5/6/19, 11:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, don't let these things distract you and please focus
5/6/19, 11:59 AM - Shona 😍: 😬😊🤗🥰 I'm glad that you push me to do things
5/6/19, 12:07 PM - Shona 😍: I love you
5/6/19, 12:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/6/19, 1:10 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
5/6/19, 2:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow the book is so intense that I can't sleep properly
5/6/19, 2:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I maybe because of quitting the meds too
5/6/19, 2:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I just keep thinking about the book again and again and again
5/6/19, 2:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thought after thought
5/6/19, 2:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Concept after concept
5/6/19, 2:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it severes the quality of my sleep
5/6/19, 3:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am glad that I have that effect on you.
5/6/19, 4:06 PM - Shona 😍: It is quite something
5/6/19, 4:06 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm could be either or the combination

5/6/19, 4:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙃
5/6/19, 4:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't you just know how to take my breath away
5/6/19, 4:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You dog
5/6/19, 4:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nope. I don't have hypertension. My status was just about people from Game of Thrones
5/6/19, 4:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because the current scenario poses a hypertension threat for them
5/6/19, 4:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂
5/6/19, 4:11 PM - Shona 😍: Okay? So it has nothing to do with you?
5/6/19, 4:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No darling. 😆
5/6/19, 4:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Babbyyyyyy❤

5/6/19, 4:12 PM - Shona 😍: But I thought you just somehow combined those two
5/6/19, 4:12 PM - Shona 😍: The series and your problem or something 😅
5/6/19, 4:12 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/6/19, 4:12 PM - Shona 😍: Well I'm relieved

5/6/19, 4:13 PM - Shona 😍: Quite well! I have my focus back ❤
5/6/19, 4:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it's solved
5/6/19, 4:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You just need me
5/6/19, 4:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you will always have me.
5/6/19, 4:14 PM - Shona 😍: I hope the book don't give you hypertension either
5/6/19, 4:14 PM - Shona 😍: ❤
5/6/19, 4:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad that I have that effect on you. ❤
5/6/19, 4:14 PM - Shona 😍: Also last night I pretty much forced myself to eat more
5/6/19, 4:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it will. It's one hell of a read.
5/6/19, 4:14 PM - Shona 😍: I think that helped too

5/6/19, 5:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like discussing all of them with you. Literally all of them. It's like I have so much to say on every line.

5/6/19, 6:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know how it works between the two of you but I can imagine he is like Mausi. He wants to spend time with you but he won't say it. Ask Mom to insist him to come to the play. I think he will make it in the second shift of the play.
5/6/19, 6:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hm.. I imagined. He needs the money for his wedding 😄
5/6/19, 6:10 PM - Shona 😍: 😁

5/7/19, 1:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am no one to poke my nose and I shouldn't be judging him but he needs to learn a few things about family 🤨
5/7/19, 1:03 AM - Shona 😍: Ah! 17th of May
5/7/19, 1:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was actually thinking about this today and something that I have thought of in the past that what's the point of money? What's the point of earning if you can't spend time with your family. Actually, I thought if I were in place of Jaari, I would have dropped everything to come and see you and I would have done the same if I were in Mikko's place. But I guess not all men are sensitive and sensible like me. Maybe I need to be a little less sensitive or maybe they just need to be a bit more.... empathetic and sensitive
5/7/19, 1:07 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm. Maybe it's a question of values. And I really admire yours ❤
5/7/19, 1:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course you do. You are sleeping with me you dog. Your hormones are clouding your judgement 😝
5/7/19, 1:09 AM - Shona 😍: Ahem... I first liked and admired your values, _then_ I wanted to sleep with you!
5/7/19, 1:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really like calling you a dog . I really find it naughty+funny+cute+loving
5/7/19, 1:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I have been told
5/7/19, 1:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please tell me about your day.

5/7/19, 1:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hey. Eat something quickly and finish your night time routine first

5/7/19, 1:14 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm can you tell me about yours while I eat?
5/7/19, 1:14 AM - Shona 😍: How's Maasi?
5/7/19, 1:14 AM - Shona 😍: Can I call her that?
5/7/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course darling 🤭😊🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🙂
5/7/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maasi means mother's sister
5/7/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah you've told :)
5/7/19, 1:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I woke up from a very bad sleep. I slept at around two last night and then I woke up at 5 am in the morning. Maasi usually gets up at that time and doesn't let anyone sleep after that ( sounds annoying but it actually is very funny and adorable) and then I felt sleepy but couldn't sleep so I essentially wanted a lot of time like that . Then ate breakfast by 7 and then there was nothing much to do so read newspaper and wasted more time until 9 the. She left then I typed your message then I masturbated and then I talked to you and then I masturbated again. And then I watched game of thrones. And then I slept a little.  Woke up again and then tried reading the book. Had an orgasm. Read more about behavioral finance and so many good experiments and facts and then talked to you and then went shopping came back, had dinner, read a little more and then listened to the podcast and then talked to Laura then Annika then you. And here we are.
5/7/19, 1:26 AM - Shona 😍: She doesn't let anyone else sleep either 😅🤭 hmm reading the newspaper is useful. So lot of orgasms for one day 😁 oh and in the pub people were talking about got and I thought okay should I educate myself and watch it too😂 and someone else said their blood pressure rising because of it 😂😂😂
5/7/19, 1:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂

5/7/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm let me rephrase that😬
5/7/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: Making love to each other
5/7/19, 3:48 PM - Shona 😍: Btw
5/7/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: It's Nelli's birthday today :D
5/7/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: She turned 11 ❤
5/7/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: I was just checking the exam I gave a week ago
5/7/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
5/7/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: I had made the silliest mistakes in physics
5/7/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: Seriously
5/7/19, 5:02 PM - Shona 😍: Calculating the intensity of a sound, I had used the _volume_ of a sphere instead of the surface area
5/7/19, 5:03 PM - Shona 😍: The question was worth 10 points, I got zero 😂
5/7/19, 5:04 PM - Shona 😍: There was something else funny with that question too
5/7/19, 5:04 PM - Shona 😍: Gonna have to see about it
5/7/19, 7:15 PM - Shona 😍: What are you up to?
5/7/19, 7:16 PM - Shona 😍: I haven't seen you offline for this long at daytime since you got locked out of your apartment in Espoo!
5/7/19, 7:16 PM - Shona 😍: I hope everything is alright
5/7/19, 8:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤❤
5/7/19, 8:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What's intensity to do with volume :/
5/7/19, 8:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah it was. I just got a little high.
5/7/19, 9:04 PM - Shona 😍: I almost got worried
5/7/19, 9:05 PM - Shona 😍: The last time I heard of you you were in a car so my mind started to wander a teeny bit
5/7/19, 9:06 PM - Shona 😍: It doesn't 😂
5/7/19, 9:06 PM - Shona 😍: That was my mistake, I uaes the formula for volume even though I was thinking of the surface area... I don't know what my brain was on
5/7/19, 9:07 PM - Shona 😍: But I feel so relieved, I did the "difficult" questions from that exam and they weren't really difficult!
5/7/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: Ah but silly me! You told me you were gonna get high on the 6th or 7th! I'd forgotten.
5/7/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh
5/7/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hormones?
5/7/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See, I told you it's some blessing in disguise- that exam
5/7/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's ok.
5/7/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I still would want to talk to you
5/7/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/7/19, 9:18 PM - Shona 😍: Babyyy
5/7/19, 9:18 PM - Shona 😍: Let's talk
5/7/19, 9:18 PM - Shona 😍: But first
5/7/19, 9:19 PM - Shona 😍: Let me go to the k-market
5/7/19, 9:20 PM - Shona 😍: I got a delivery
5/7/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Delivery?
5/7/19, 9:34 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
5/7/19, 9:34 PM - Shona 😍: You see
5/7/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No i can't
5/7/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: My other boyfriend from Lebanon sent me something
5/7/19, 9:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Who is he!
5/7/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I knew you were going to chest on me someday because I am not able to sexually satisfy you
5/7/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I had a very very nice conversation with Laura yesterday
5/7/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: That's great!!
5/7/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: I actually told her today to talk with you about long distance relationships :D
5/7/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: She's in one herself
5/7/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah she told
5/7/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: And I thought since you two seem to share some characteristics maybe you can give her some advice
5/7/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But why me. I am not successful at long distance relationships. You are. I never survived one before this so my hit rate is not 100% but you got it right in the first one so you are the expert.
5/7/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah.
5/7/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But how come she got into a relationship with this new guy when she was already seeing her friend?
5/7/19, 9:42 PM - Shona 😍: No she wasn't
5/7/19, 9:42 PM - Shona 😍: That ended real fast
5/7/19, 9:42 PM - Shona 😍: With the friend
5/7/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/7/19, 9:43 PM - Shona 😍: But you are! You've done so well with this one. But hmm maybe I know something too
5/7/19, 9:43 PM - Shona 😍: How's the high by the way?
5/7/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's over.
5/7/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Okay?
5/7/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. I got high in the noon
5/7/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About 6 hours ago
5/7/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: So it ends that fast?
5/7/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It ends in about 2 hours.
5/7/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaa
5/7/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are a little tipsy after that
5/7/19, 9:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you can definitely control yourself
5/7/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/7/19, 9:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Before that, it's a different person kind of thing.
5/7/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: Well how was it when you still were high?
5/7/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: Was this stuff any better?
5/7/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: Babyyy
5/7/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: I missed you
5/7/19, 10:02 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry was this too much?
5/7/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😊 I have such great ideas when I am high. I wish to tell you some of those someday
5/7/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. it was.
5/7/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How are you being so supportive these days? 😅
5/7/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh I missed you too. It's so hard not to text you
5/7/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just crave talking to you so mucj
5/7/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well. I rarely get jealous when it comes to my partners but I want to get a bit jealous and the statement made me at least think about it so as of now I didn't mind. And of course this explanation has a smaller version as well. And it is:
"No!" 😅
5/7/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: Because I love youuuuuuuuuuuuuu
5/7/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: Ok 😬
5/7/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You very rarely talk so freely. I am very much in love with this you.
5/7/19, 10:11 PM - Shona 😍: I'm feeling very happy
5/7/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About?
5/7/19, 10:11 PM - Shona 😍: Everything
5/7/19, 10:11 PM - Shona 😍: Life
5/7/19, 10:11 PM - Shona 😍: You
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know I am a sensational boyfriend but what else. 😊😅
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: The exam I checked today
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: The play
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😊
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: Bhangra
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: Laura and Mikko
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: Mum
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: Dad
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: Nelli
5/7/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: You again:D
5/7/19, 10:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wanted to say something. Earlier I used to see the dance videos that I sent you and then I used to never think about doing them actually and I never really even thought of trying but having seen you do Bhangra, I can imagine a life in which I am able to do those things and not just be a spectator. You make me want to explore that side of mine.
5/7/19, 10:14 PM - Shona 😍: Yes!!! Let's do Bhangra together 😍
5/7/19, 10:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking about it today and I just couldn't stop admiring that side of our bond. How you motivate me.
5/7/19, 10:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please! You will totally feel complexed having seen me dance. I am just such a natural
5/7/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a joke please don't get all worked up🙄
5/7/19, 10:18 PM - Shona 😍: Same here. You really lifted me up after my last week's  struggle.
5/7/19, 10:18 PM - Shona 😍: I won't
5/7/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I fear the day when I won't be able to.
5/7/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: Also, I'm very gritty so with practice I'll be awesome, even if I'm not a natural 😁
5/7/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: Baby I don't think that day will come
5/7/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: And if it does
5/7/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: _Then_ I go to therapy
5/7/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
5/7/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ooo. Telling by our past endeavors we will have to be gritty in sex as well
5/7/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙃
5/7/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: :PP
5/7/19, 10:21 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I've had really nice orgasms these past days
5/7/19, 10:21 PM - Shona 😍: Thinking about new things
5/7/19, 10:21 PM - Shona 😍: With you
5/7/19, 10:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh? So the sex story worked for you 😄
5/7/19, 10:22 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah well then I continued the stories on my own 😄
5/7/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Want to tell me one?
5/7/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok, I was thinking about it yesterday, and I couldn't imagine how people beat their spouses. I have seen mom do it but I still can't gauge how do people get the courage to do that. I mean how does it get so complicated that one person finds the courage to do it and then the other person feels compelled to stay. And on top of it, what is the need or desire or pleasure that drives such actions. It is so wrong to me. I just am not able to imagine at all. Tauji's daughter was in  a marriage in which her husband used to beat her so much that she used to go and hide behind shrubs. I just was so amazed to hear that story. What is that world in which she felt so incapable that she kept going back to her. And what was he smoking that he felt that that's something he can do. It also reminds me of Laura and how she is fighting against domestic violence. I heard another story in which a completely healthy person of my city beat his girlfriend with a pan and then she died of a blow and then this person hanged himself. I still was the wondering that during the life I have lived I have never had one instance ok may be one or two but never again, to which I can point and say that yeah that was something so dramatic that it can compell me to lay a hand on my partner
5/7/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *kept going back to him
5/7/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to say. I've maybe told you that that's the most horrifying thing I can imagine, the person who's supposed to be your closest friend and safe haven doing something like that. But I know not all people feel like that about relationships or marriages.
5/7/19, 10:39 PM - Shona 😍: But that is a very good question that what is it that actually drives such deeds and urges
5/7/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you think of a scenario?
5/7/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. I had an idea but I googled a bit too. It's much more common that the victims are women and it's more common in countries with poorer gender equality. What I also thought of was that when you somehow feel... entitled to another person, like when men think women as property or something, I think it's easier to do whatever you feel like doing if you're angry for example. I mean if the idea is that the woman is supposed to do what the man wants and she doesn't, that might be one reason. Like a punishment, or trying to intimidate the other to do what you want. In the reverse situation, if women do it, I would imagine the mindset could be the same? You somehow feel like the other person is in some way less than you or "owes" you something, maybe then you might feel like you can do it. And I self-defense is one possible reason ofc.
5/7/19, 11:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But still, to me I don't get any of those. Do you mistreat what you own? Do you not treat it with care? And this is a human We are talking about. How can one forget that?! And also what's the point of vengeance, especially with your loved one. Isn't your love compelling you to forgive the other person? And what can be so wrong that you are so mad that you think beating will change them
5/7/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. Maybe you should beat me for starting a topic such as that 🙄
5/7/19, 11:16 PM - Shona 😍: Well I don't understand it either, and I agree with you on those things. But I think it has to do with the way one's brought up too. But it is very interesting though, like when does it happen that if you see it as a child you start doing it yourself, and when does it happen that you realize that it is wrong and you don't want to do it yourself. Like what happens, and what's the difference between these people. Also an interesting question is that when does it all start. Like if kids learn it from their parents, what's the first thing that starts it with their parents
5/7/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: Not funnyyyyyyyy
5/7/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry, to me it is adorable. The beating I had in mind was of the puccha and I will kill you kind
5/7/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And also, what is the pleasure that one derives from such acts of violence? Is it psychopathy? Is it sadism? Is it lust for power and superiority?
5/7/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/D2SoGHFM18I
5/7/19, 11:24 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm okay 😬
5/7/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know
5/7/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Weird life
5/7/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad we both are not like that
5/7/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I kiss you
5/7/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: Me too ❤
5/7/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: Pusu
5/7/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Susu means piss in Hindi. What does pusu mean?
5/7/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: Of course it means piss in Hindi 😂😂😂 all the sweet words in Finnish are something unpleasant in Hindi, I wonder why is that
5/7/19, 11:30 PM - Shona 😍: But for at least the third time rakas, it means puccha
5/7/19, 11:35 PM - Shona 😍: 😚
5/7/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok sorry 😅
5/7/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: Btw. This is maybe the cutest picture ever.
5/7/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: I saw it again today in my files
5/7/19, 11:38 PM - Shona 😍: And it is seriously adorable
5/7/19, 11:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I sometimes wonder
5/7/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I had a reserve of such things
5/7/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I could just automate the process of sending you one item from it each day
5/7/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: 😄
5/7/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: Of such photos?
5/7/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And gestures
5/7/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: Also I really like it that you do start such topics
5/7/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: I like hearing your thoughts about them
5/7/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. Do you have any such topic in mind?
5/7/19, 11:59 PM - Shona 😍: Not on the top of my mind rn
5/8/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: But I will note them down when I think of one
5/8/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh come on. Think.
5/8/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
5/8/19, 12:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe you shouldn't. It may hamper your focus
5/8/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby I am very sleepy. Very.
5/8/19, 12:02 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/8/19, 12:02 AM - Shona 😍: Good night kultaseni 🌜
5/8/19, 12:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
5/8/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: :)
5/8/19, 12:54 AM - Shona 😍: Well of course I had plenty of possible topics in mind. It's just that they take a lot of time when discussed properly. I felt like asking you not to go, but then I thought you didn't sleep much last night, and I'm having a good streak with studying rn, and the exam will be in one week. And that in turn made me think of the balance between work and other life. Laura is now struggling with balancing hers with the new relationship. And then I also remembered what Michelle Obama told about her and Barack's relationship and how they've spent a lot of time apart too. And then I thought if all the different kind of relationships and how people make them work for themselves. And then I wondered how will we manage it ourselves later, and if what we're doing now is good balance. Do you feel it's well balanced? Are you happy with how things are, for now? Is there something you'd like to have more? Both of our schedules are gonna change next week.
Another thing I've been thinking about is our conversation on Sunday, and more specifically when I told you I was so sorry I felt like sitting at your feet and how you said that that's not what I'm worthy of and what you'd do to me instead. That was so romantic and moving to me. Saying such things like sitting at someone's feet and actually doing it doesn't mean much in the west, or at least in Finland today. Doing something like that is probably considered ancient. However when I said that and when I think of that it reminds me of the biblical times and what I've read from the Bible. And I imagine it's something people would do to show the utmost respect and devotion. And I don't know how to describe it, but what you replied made my heart... sing. Somehow what you do and say, who you are speaks to me on some entirely different level. It speaks to my soul and it feels like it's out f this world. Right now I'm crying as I write this because I'm so happy. What you said about the domestic violence topic also reminded me of the connection that we have. Sharing those same values. Then, also about the sitting at someone's feet, it made me think of the first times I came to Espoo. I remembered you sat on the floor while I was sitting on the couch. I did not understand why you did that. I think I explained it to myself that you just felt like sitting on the floor, maybe it was more comfortable, sometimes I prefer sitting on the floor myself. But why did you sit on the floor? And another time I was lying on the bed and you were on the floor next to me. To me that was very sweet.
5/8/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: Good night armainpani.
5/8/19, 12:57 AM - Shona 😍: And now, armainpani probably means something horrible in Hindi, but in Finnish it's "my dearest one"
5/8/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: One small correction, the word I was looking for is not romantic, but just plain beautiful
5/8/19, 9:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
5/8/19, 9:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❤❤
5/8/19, 9:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know what sitting at someone's feet means and I knew exactly what you said meant back when you said it. I know it because we have had it in our culture as well that when someone was really sorry in our epics they sat near someones feet. There have been other instances with people doing all kinds of gestures to the other in order to say sorry and doing all kinds of sorry gestures like washing their feet with one's tears/ kissing someone's feet/ placing their feet on your head. Basically foot jobs 😂. But seriously, I understand the significance of feet and the rhetoric that they carry. And that is exactly what I had in mind when I sat down on the floor and you were sitting on the sofa. I wanted to somehow pay you my respect and that is why I sat down. And when you were laying on the bed that day, I felt like serving you in some sense, you know taking care of you and somehow like you are superior to me and I wanted to serve you and that is why I sat on the floor. Obviously there was also the reason that it was a much more convenient position to see you and talk to you.  

But the point is that I get, the sitting down to one's feet gesture. In India there is a very very ubiquitous tradition of touching the feet of your elders. Daily in the morning or before you leave the house. It is a sign of respect nd somehow an opportunity for them to bless you.(they all do that very often) I do that myself, I touch my mother's feet daily before I leave the house. So I understand what the gesture means. I think you will have to do it after the marriage to. Ok, it's not like you will have to do it but I always feel that mom would want my wife to and since she is so close me I would want my wife to but then again I will never force you to do any Auch thing and it's upto you to choose. 
But I will never let you touch mine. Because, I never will let you be beneath me. You _are_ superior and you will always be.
5/8/19, 9:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will type a different reply for the balance message.
5/8/19, 9:50 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning ☀
5/8/19, 9:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mom made very tasty south Indian food for breakfast 😍
5/8/19, 9:52 AM - Shona 😍: 😍😍😍
5/8/19, 9:52 AM - Shona 😍: What was it?
5/8/19, 9:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Idli sambar
5/8/19, 9:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We will have it when you come here
5/8/19, 9:53 AM - Shona 😍: 😊😊😊
5/8/19, 9:58 AM - Shona 😍: This is all very, very interesting
5/8/19, 10:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can imagine. Although what I can't understand is that how did I not tell you this before? 😄
And now I am wondering what all i have not told you?🙁
5/8/19, 10:05 AM - Shona 😍: Well these things will come up :)
5/8/19, 10:06 AM - Shona 😍: It is possible that you've mentioned something about it though 🤔
5/8/19, 10:06 AM - Shona 😍: Also
5/8/19, 10:07 AM - Shona 😍: I just thought like what if I or you were to try to do it to my parents and how they would be like what the hell is going on 😂
5/8/19, 10:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Omg😮😬🤯🤣
5/8/19, 10:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't think of that😄
5/8/19, 10:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will be an awesome video reaction to upload on the internet
5/8/19, 10:09 AM - Shona 😍: Yes 😂😂😂
5/8/19, 10:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/-MLU4jJK2sQ
5/8/19, 10:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I didn't like to hear the news about Laura. Should we do something about it? Maybe talk to her?
5/8/19, 10:18 AM - Shona 😍: 🤭😂🤭😂
5/8/19, 10:18 AM - Shona 😍: Hmmm.
5/8/19, 10:18 AM - Shona 😍: Wwll she asked for my and Mikko's advice yesterday
5/8/19, 10:18 AM - Shona 😍: Like how to keep it under control
5/8/19, 10:18 AM - Shona 😍: I wasn't exactly sure what to say
5/8/19, 10:19 AM - Shona 😍: I managed to control myself mostly by just being very strict with my schedule and thinking about the exam
5/8/19, 10:20 AM - Shona 😍: But I don't think it's very useful advice to say "just control yourself"
5/8/19, 10:21 AM - Shona 😍: And obviously I shifted my schedules a bit and sometimes we talked when I was supposed to study for example or I stayed up later than I planned
5/8/19, 10:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/Ow0lbyPkpnU
5/8/19, 10:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Watch this and come back by the time I type
5/8/19, 10:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
5/8/19, 10:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is and it's not. Depends on the person. I always feel that advice should be given keeping in mind the person. What makes them tick and hence what will work for them
5/8/19, 10:28 AM - Shona 😍: Awww
5/8/19, 10:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I plan to stay whenever you want me to but I was very very sleepy yesterday. I just wanted to sleep. I am glad I did. I slept for 9 good hours. Nine wow hours infact. I just feel very very relaxed rn
5/8/19, 10:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ikr?
5/8/19, 10:29 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah... I'm not sure what that is for Laura in these things
5/8/19, 10:30 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah I thought you were sleepy, I knew you hadn't slept much the previous night :) I'm glad that you slept too
5/8/19, 10:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message
5/8/19, 10:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it is the need for achievement. People start to think that a relationship is something completely different from your success and that it is also a distraction to their success. We all have been there, you used to think like that, I used to and may be she does to. But now we know that relationships don't have to be an accessory, if anything there are an enabler in what we want to be. They are the driving force, our balm to all our worries that in turn enables us to achieve all that we want to. Maybe she is facing the same thing. Trying to manage the two to me at least sounds like you think that the two are different. I think in our relationship as well it works because we cool each other down love each other and with the energy thus replenished we go on to achieve other things. She has to stop thinking them as apart but she has to see them in line as if one is joined to the other.
5/8/19, 10:34 AM - Shona 😍: But from what I know in the past, she can be very..... intense. Like go all in in a relatively short time and invest herself in it very much
5/8/19, 10:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sounds someone like me. Make her speak to me. I will try speaking to her myself
5/8/19, 10:35 AM - Shona 😍: Exactly what I was thinking
5/8/19, 10:35 AM - Shona 😍: I already told her to
5/8/19, 10:37 AM - Shona 😍: Hmmm. Maybe so, what you said in the last sentence. But I don't actually know how exactly she sees at at the moment
5/8/19, 10:37 AM - Shona 😍: *it at
5/8/19, 10:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well we will see. Rome was not built in a day and she certainly is larger a than rome
5/8/19, 10:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ~a~
5/8/19, 10:39 AM - Shona 😍: 😅
5/8/19, 10:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Babbyyyyyy
5/8/19, 10:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish to ask you something
5/8/19, 10:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very objectively
5/8/19, 10:39 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/8/19, 10:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah
5/8/19, 10:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Leave it
5/8/19, 10:40 AM - Shona 😍: Baby.
5/8/19, 10:40 AM - Shona 😍: Ask.
5/8/19, 10:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I shouldn't do it at this hour
5/8/19, 10:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will be distracted
5/8/19, 10:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just wanted to ask if you are aroused by any chance
5/8/19, 10:41 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm I'm not atm. I think I will be in about 3-4hours :D
5/8/19, 10:41 AM - Shona 😍: After studying
5/8/19, 10:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Call me then
5/8/19, 10:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
5/8/19, 10:42 AM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmm
5/8/19, 10:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Omg. English people are so hot. 😍 The accent. That reminds me. I love it when you do accents. In Russian and in British accent
5/8/19, 10:49 AM - Shona 😍: The accent is very hot
5/8/19, 10:49 AM - Shona 😍: And also, Australian accent.... O m g
5/8/19, 10:51 AM - Shona 😍: Now I also wonder how can that be asked objectively? :D isn't being aroused kind of a subjective experience
5/8/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No what I meant was that please don't take it as a hint for getting vyou aroused. I just meant like a yes or a no question. Don't start thinking in that direction because then you will be distracted
5/8/19, 11:07 AM - Shona 😍: Ah
5/8/19, 11:07 AM - Shona 😍: I see
5/8/19, 11:09 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm let's try it sometime
5/8/19, 11:09 AM - Shona 😍: Me talking in Russian and us having sex
5/8/19, 11:09 AM - Shona 😍: I'm intrigued
5/8/19, 11:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See. *O B J E C T I V E L Y*
5/8/19, 11:10 AM - Shona 😍: Uuuuh
5/8/19, 11:10 AM - Shona 😍: And you speaking in Hindi
5/8/19, 11:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fuck objectivity. That's hot. 😄
5/8/19, 11:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, that's excellent feedback😅
5/8/19, 11:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But do you realize the beauty of the idea? It is not only arousing to hear each other what we like to listen but it is also arousing to know that your partner is aroused so much. And you are the reason for their arousal.
5/8/19, 11:16 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah!
5/8/19, 11:18 AM - Shona 😍: But damn it now I _am_ getting aroused 😂
5/8/19, 11:18 AM - Shona 😍: Please say something not sexy
5/8/19, 11:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Pusu
5/8/19, 11:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
5/8/19, 11:18 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm did you mean susu
5/8/19, 11:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes😅😂🤣
5/8/19, 11:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you have those small sachets of effervescent material for acidity in Finland?
5/8/19, 11:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was just wondering if it can be used to give yourself a homemade colon cleanup
5/8/19, 11:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You pour one of those sachets using a funnel via your asshole
5/8/19, 11:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then drink a lot of water
5/8/19, 11:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How do you like the idea?
5/8/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: Is that supposed to be not sexy?
5/8/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: I mean it definitely is
5/8/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: Not sexy
5/8/19, 11:22 AM - Shona 😍: But first thing I thought when hearing that was having anal
5/8/19, 11:22 AM - Shona 😍: Sex after that
5/8/19, 11:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was supposed to be grouse
5/8/19, 11:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hence definitely not sexy but damn are you aroused
5/8/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: It's the body parts involved :D
5/8/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: But now I'm out with Nelli
5/8/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: And soon I'll pick up her crap
5/8/19, 11:24 AM - Shona 😍: Yep there it is
5/8/19, 11:24 AM - Shona 😍: 😂
5/8/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh yes 😍🙉🤲🏻🤪💩😋
5/8/19, 11:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you ever smell something while you are crapping in the morning and get reminded of what you ate last night?
5/8/19, 11:28 AM - Shona 😍: YÄK :D
5/8/19, 11:28 AM - Shona 😍: Hmmm
5/8/19, 11:28 AM - Shona 😍: Sometimes makes me think
5/8/19, 11:28 AM - Shona 😍: If the smell is... Unusual
5/8/19, 11:28 AM - Shona 😍: That what did I eat
5/8/19, 11:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I often smell it
5/8/19, 11:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I wonder what did I eat
5/8/19, 11:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd then since I am a foodie I always eat something good
5/8/19, 11:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then i start drooling thinking about that good food
5/8/19, 11:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hence I am drooling by smelling my poop
5/8/19, 11:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
5/8/19, 11:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I remember once drooling over Nelli's remembering she ate Nakki
5/8/19, 11:34 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to think now 😂
5/8/19, 11:34 AM - Shona 😍: Good God
5/8/19, 11:34 AM - Shona 😍: That's... Quite something
5/8/19, 11:35 AM - Shona 😍: 😂
5/8/19, 11:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If this didn't derouse you then I don't know what will
5/8/19, 11:35 AM - Shona 😍: It did 😂😂
5/8/19, 11:35 AM - Shona 😍: Thank you
5/8/19, 11:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See
5/8/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know you love me because of such intelligence and intellectual thoughts
5/8/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you too for all the crap picking and crap cleaning
5/8/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Crap crap crap crao

5/8/19, 11:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We just had a water fight😁
5/8/19, 11:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Di threw a teaspoon of water on us from Mom's glass and then we soaked her wet 😅
5/8/19, 11:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then she threw more back and now the house is a mess 😂😂🤣
5/8/19, 11:53 AM - Shona 😍: 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤭

5/8/19, 11:55 AM - Shona 😍: 😊😊😊
5/8/19, 11:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know right 🥰
5/8/19, 12:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We were just discussing that. I don't know how to be more thankful to god and I don't know what more to expect from life
5/8/19, 12:44 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what words or emoji to use. I love you and I'm so happy for you. And I'm most grateful and happy myself.
5/8/19, 12:45 PM - Shona 😍: I just had breakfast with mum

5/8/19, 12:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With me and my family
5/8/19, 12:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you both are afraid because you are afraid of the unknown and what's on the other side
5/8/19, 12:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: However, knowing the two of you I know it's going to be ok
5/8/19, 12:49 PM - Shona 😍: I just realized I lied too
5/8/19, 12:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ooooo
5/8/19, 12:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ouch
5/8/19, 12:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤔
5/8/19, 12:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well you didn't do that intentionally and you can tell her the truth
5/8/19, 12:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not something to hide
5/8/19, 12:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, my mom just knows that we are friends and we talk regularly
5/8/19, 12:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that's the complete situation
5/8/19, 12:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can tell her that
5/8/19, 12:52 PM - Shona 😍: Well I kind of did. I deliberately didn't say that you told her we broke up
5/8/19, 12:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't see any harm
5/8/19, 12:52 PM - Shona 😍: Oh!
5/8/19, 12:52 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't know that
5/8/19, 12:53 PM - Shona 😍: For both of us it's something we didn't expect
5/8/19, 12:53 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm yes

5/8/19, 2:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😁
5/8/19, 4:01 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if I should check the results from the last exam 😳
5/8/19, 4:01 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not that scared after yesterday

5/8/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm mum didn't sound very happy with the result
5/8/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: I mean she wasn't negative either
5/8/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: But she was like mm-m okay
5/8/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: It's likely that you get it but if you don't then there's something else for you
5/8/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: And that I didn't find very encouraging 🤥
5/8/19, 11:30 PM - Shona 😍: *Get in
5/8/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well
5/8/19, 11:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was talking about something like this with Mom today
5/8/19, 11:34 PM - Shona 😍: ?
5/8/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We hardly think we are ever wrong
5/8/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A man finds their actions right
5/8/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mostly
5/8/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nevertheless, you know what's right
5/8/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it's hard to find someone who does and thinks exactly like you
5/8/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So what essentially happens is
5/8/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you are never going to find someone who thinks and acts completely like you
5/8/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hence his actions will not align with your thinking and hence not with what you think is right
5/8/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You cannot change this, it's the truth about the world
5/8/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: True
5/8/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So what you can essentially do is that despite trying to change the other person or feeling bad about the inconsistency you can simply accept the fact that it wasn't what you expected
5/8/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And move on
5/8/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's your life and only you know how to live it better. Anyone else's opinion doesn't matter at all
5/8/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Her disappointment should not matter. Because you know what went wrong and how to make it right.
5/8/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: You are right. Though I guess some people can give good advice, but I'm gonna have to evaluate the advice myself and think if it works for me
5/8/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah...
5/8/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad you agree.
5/8/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I saw the breakup of the questions
5/8/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know if you would have just done one more question
5/8/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It would have made the difference

5/9/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exactly. I didn't type any further because I was myself skeptical that this conversation has many directions
5/9/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
5/9/19, 10:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He is married tho
5/9/19, 10:59 AM - Shona 😍: 😁
5/9/19, 11:00 AM - Shona 😍: Well that's not perfect then 🤔
5/9/19, 11:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It may be. You don't know
5/9/19, 11:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Married people have their own advantages
5/9/19, 11:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really feel very close to you. Especially after realizing that we both had the same thought
5/9/19, 11:08 AM - Shona 😍: Well, why do you feel he'd be perfect for me then?
5/9/19, 11:08 AM - Shona 😍: 😙
5/9/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because he is a true gentleman
5/9/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Doesn't abuse
5/9/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Doesn't lie
5/9/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He is religious
5/9/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Kind
5/9/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Soft spoken

5/9/19, 11:10 AM - Shona 😍: Uh-huh
5/9/19, 11:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to see him?
5/9/19, 11:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: BTW. What kind of a boyfriend am I? Pitching for someone else to my own love 🤪
5/9/19, 11:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe the kind that feels so secure that he genuinely feels she will never leave him
5/9/19, 11:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or the kind who thinks she deserves better 😒
5/9/19, 11:14 AM - Shona 😍: That's a good question. I understand that it is a joke, but on the other hand I don't even want to start thinking in that direction, because it would actually be wrong in so many levels.
5/9/19, 11:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
5/9/19, 11:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's not to that
5/9/19, 11:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This might be one of those accidental self sabotage moments
5/9/19, 11:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In which I start a chain reaction of shitty events that suck up my life
5/9/19, 11:17 AM - Shona 😍: So let's not continue in this direction any further.
5/9/19, 11:17 AM - Shona 😍: Other direction :
5/9/19, 11:17 AM - Shona 😍: Oh so did you find a mirror?
5/9/19, 11:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wow!
5/9/19, 11:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have got some skills girl
5/9/19, 11:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No they were your eyes  ❤
5/9/19, 11:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you are still a child in these things.
5/9/19, 11:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Learn from Daddy
5/9/19, 11:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤪
5/9/19, 11:20 AM - Shona 😍: Yikes :D
5/9/19, 11:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am so enjoying this conversation
5/9/19, 11:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😍😍
5/9/19, 11:27 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/9/19, 11:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You not?
5/9/19, 11:32 AM - Shona 😍: I've thought about it before that would it be hot or gross if you said something like that.
5/9/19, 11:33 AM - Shona 😍: Also what I was still thinking that should we think about what triggered that in you
5/9/19, 11:33 AM - Shona 😍: I could not come to a conclusion :D
5/9/19, 11:37 AM - Shona 😍: I was
5/9/19, 11:37 AM - Shona 😍: *I was
5/9/19, 11:39 AM - Shona 😍: Before this :D
5/9/19, 11:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think this did
5/9/19, 11:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you felt bad or timid? 😬
5/9/19, 12:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby?
5/9/19, 12:16 PM - Shona 😍: I was having breakfast with mum!
5/9/19, 12:16 PM - Shona 😍: We talked about me coming to India, among other things 😁
5/9/19, 12:17 PM - Shona 😍: Neither, it was just like umm okay hmm don't know how I feel about that
5/9/19, 12:18 PM - Shona 😍: Should we have a proper discussion about that at some point?
5/9/19, 12:23 PM - Shona 😍: Actually, that's not a question. We should.
5/9/19, 12:25 PM - Shona 😍: Also, mum was hesitant about sharing some of her worries about her work... I don't know if she thought it would desturb my focus with the exam or what
5/9/19, 12:26 PM - Shona 😍: *Disturb
5/9/19, 12:26 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe so. She said we can talk about it later
5/9/19, 12:28 PM - Shona 😍: That conversation started with us talking about handling nerves in stressful situations and I told her what I heard in the power of habit, Michael Phelps's mental preparation, like how he visualized the situations beforehand so that the brain got used to it
5/9/19, 12:28 PM - Shona 😍: Baby please send me a selfie ❤
5/9/19, 12:28 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna start studying now :)
5/9/19, 1:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe we should
5/9/19, 1:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Whatever it is. I think you should push for it and talk to her. I was thinking about it yesterday that there comes a time in every parents life that the cycle reverses and they start learning from their children. I think you _should_ talk to her.
5/9/19, 1:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/9/19, 1:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/9/19, 1:32 PM - Shona 😍: ❤❤❤❤❤❤
5/9/19, 1:34 PM - Shona 😍: You are. The. Cutest.
5/9/19, 1:36 PM - Shona 😍: That's true. I mean if the parents are willing to.
5/9/19, 2:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/9/19, 2:39 PM - Shona 😍: ☀⛱🥵
5/9/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I sometimes wonder what will you think about my mental health or about me in general if you were to make sense or listen to the songs I make up when alone or the things that I say to myself while driving or my actions in general when I am alone 🤣🤪
5/9/19, 3:09 PM - Shona 😍: I think many people do such things when alone. I certainly do :D saying really weird shit, singing, dancing, doing funny accents, laughing at my own thoughts... And driving alone is certainly one of the best times to do them!
5/9/19, 3:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to let me in on those someday?
5/9/19, 3:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have some great news for you
5/9/19, 5:24 PM - Shona 😍: I already have to some of them :)
5/9/19, 5:25 PM - Shona 😍: Yay what is it??
5/9/19, 5:26 PM - Shona 😍: I just napped for almost 2h 😳😳😳
5/9/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh. Thats good
5/9/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am yours for the next ten days
5/9/19, 5:27 PM - Shona 😍: Oh?????!
5/9/19, 5:27 PM - Shona 😍: The internship? Starts on the 20th?
5/9/19, 5:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/9/19, 5:55 PM - Shona 😍: ❤❤❤❤
5/9/19, 6:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Completely yourd
5/9/19, 6:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *yours
5/9/19, 6:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well yourd is also not incorrect
5/9/19, 7:11 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm what is yourd
5/9/19, 7:30 PM - Shona 😍: I just came across something interesting. You have asked me before about what is sexy to me and if I ever just feel sexually attracted to some people that I see. I wasn't actively thinking about it today but from somewhere the term demisexuality popped into my head. I went on to google it, and in many ways it sounds familiar to me from my own experience. The main characteristic of demisexuality is that you don't feel sexually attracted to people unless you have an emotional bond with them. Other than that, it might not differ from people with "normal" sexuality, though it might. And by "normal" sexuality I mean the possibility of feeling sexually attracted to someone within seconds of seeing them. I don't know if my experience is just a result of what I was taught about sex when I was young or if it's because of my personality, probably it's a combination. And since I've had crushes on people I really haven't known, I don't know if demisexuality really applies to me. I don't feel the need to attach such a label to myself, but I just thought it's an interesting concept so I wanted to share it with you. And with our relationship, I can tell that I'm increasingly more attracted to you as I get to know you better and as I feel our bond getting stronger. I also don't know if all this is some kind of a constant, or if it can change over time. My guess is that to some extent, sexuality is something that changes over the whole lifetime.
5/9/19, 7:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. It definitely Changes and yeah it's interesting.
5/9/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish I was a demisexual 😭
5/9/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: I could wish I was a man. But I don't see any point in that. I don't think I would be any happier or any better as a person. I would just be different. And it actually wouldn't be me if I was a man. I think I am the sum of my genes, a product of my environment and culture, as well as a spiritual being. The last one is sometimes difficult to remember or even to believe. And I don't even know to what extent I believe our bodies and spirits/souls are intertwined. And I think those are all different level "identities" or explanations for what we are. Hmm that kinda escalated. My point was, if it's not something you can choose, I don't think there's any point in wishing it was different.
5/9/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: I feel like buying soooo many books
5/9/19, 9:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok?
5/9/19, 9:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then buy some!
5/9/19, 9:32 PM - Shona 😍: They're so expensive 👀  like 15e/piece at least
5/9/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: During the internship, do you need to work every day or do you have days off?
5/9/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 5 days a week
5/9/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: Well that sounds very reasonable.
5/9/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: You seem real busy today
5/9/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: What are you up to?
5/9/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Cleaning my almirah
5/9/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know but I feel a little low today
5/9/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It may be because of multiple things
5/9/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A) i did not complete all that I planned in the day. Although, having said that I did complete a lot of things in my list and they really were big things. It's just that things didn't go as planned and I couldn't do some of the things on my list and I seriously feel so irritated rn. Technically I was supposed to leave in the morning so I was supposed to complete everything by now that means if I haven't done some tasks yet then that means mom would have done it for me and I don't like that. When will I be able to do things on my own. Why can't I plan things ahead and be mature enough to take care of myself 🤬😡😠
5/9/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: B) my sister is a real pain in the ass. She has no control over herself and I feel bad about it. I got her the ear muffs and the ear plugs, I am ready to give up the AC room as well but she just can't seem to sit her ass down and study. Everyday she has some new excuses. And those are not just excuses, she starts pestering the other person and starts acting weird like a demented child or something. For instance she was apprehensive about the fact that I did not go with her to the doctor yesterday when she needed me. What is she 18? Cant she see that I had to leave tomorrow? And what was I supposed to do when she would have talked to the doctor for 45 mins? Sit outside and stress about my stuff? Or play fucking pubg?! What does she think of herself why does she have to always gain sympathy and seek pity? Why is she such a crybaby???!!! This is what she has been doing all her life. You know Shona, when we were little she used to get after maa's life when she used to fall sick. Why can't she be quiet and lay down. Maybe saving all that energy will help her heal.  Day before yesterday she reluctantly helped me pack my stuff for Delhi. And you know when someone reluctantly helps what they do? They do it in a way that is neither helpful nor needed. On top of it she made it sound like a favor. Wtf? 
Today, finally when I was setting it all up, she comes and stands. At 10pm in the night. So I ask her you took your night meds. Why don't you just sleep. She was like, I am having this, I am facing that and I am feeling this and I am experiencing that. And at one point I really felt like abusing her. That what is wrong with her. Can't she just go and lay down? What can the fuck we do about it. Go Google and try things. Are you an 8 year old that needs to be taken care of?!
5/9/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: C) I just get very sullen around birthdays. I have never liked birthdays. There can be multiple reasons for it. These are just speculations and I have not really thought about them. Maybe I don't like celebrating birthdays. Because Mom and dad always used to fight on mine like on all Sundays and Holidays. 
The other reason could be that since I am so good at pleasing other people I just feel that I should totally rock it but what generally happens is that when I can't I get upset. Its like expecting too much from yourself and failing in an exam. 😌
I also don't know what's there to celebrate, I mean so you got an year old big deal. I mean, I would rather celebrate you getting your 98% score  rather than a birthday. At least that's what I feel when I think about it. 
It somewhere is like the Introspection project, first I set the bar too high and then I kept procrastinating and in the end I just rushed into it. 
It may also be a question of what can I possibly do more. I mean the only thing I can think of slitting my wrists and gifting you my life but I am like it's a celebration of life not an occasion for taking away yours. 🤨
5/9/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry for so much information
5/9/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know I can say anything to you now. We are there and I really feel so intimate. Emotionally and physically that I feel like I can say and do anything with you. It makes me feel very warm and safe and loved. After Sunday you have stopped taking my words in a negative light and I feel more free and open. I really like the zone we are in rn.
5/9/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: In response to A) and B)
I empathize with your frustration. But getting even most of the things done is good. Sometimes even with planning we can't make it all happen. Maybe you learned something for the next time? That you need more time to complete all those things. I understand that you wouldn't want your mum have to do things for you. That's a great attitude, but we are all human after all. Sometimes we need help. What it comes to your sister. To me it sounds like she's not very happy right now with her life. And I understand the upcoming exams must be hard on her. It's a pity that you need to deal with that too, it must be hard on you as well, with all that you have going on for yourself and with my stresses too.
5/9/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: I too feel like something special happened on Sunday. I really appreciate it that you share these things that you're sharing right now with me.
5/10/19, 12:06 AM - Shona 😍: I can understand the feeling of pressure if you set the bar too high for yourself. I always have liked how in movies people get together with their friends and people prepare surprises for their friends or loved ones' birthdays. And not just in movies I know people who do it too. But the tradition that we had in my family is that someone (almost always mum) bakes a cake that the one having the birthday wishes for. And then we sing to the birthday person and give our gifts and have the cake. Nothing much special. Until we were like 10 years old or something mum used to throw us birthday parties that our friends would attend too. After that we've just done something ourselves with our friends and then celebrated with the family with the cake. My past couple birthdays have sucked pretty hard so I don't think it can get worse than it has been. Mainly they have sucked because I've felt that I should have some friends to celebrate it with but I really don't. Two or three years back I went to donate blood on my birthday. That was a nice experience and it felt somehow like a good thing to do. My point here is... I don't know. Birthdays can be awesome I guess but I don't really have much expectations. They have been what they have been for now and I don't know what they will be like in the future.
5/10/19, 12:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See I don't mind handling people. And there is nothing like handling anyone. People just need a little push. And that is how I have always imagined helping people.. by being the enabler. I am not the will-carry-you-on-my-shoukder kind of guy. I am able to help you and Mom because you guys are able to help yourself. I just help you think clearly but clearly you are the ones to do the heavy lifting. But my sister is a complete massacre. She wants someone else to decide for her and take her responsibility. Yes, she is not happy with her life, she has never been, but there is a reason for that, all her life she has been relying on others. First she chooses the wrong people in terms of friends and mentors and when they show their true colors even then she doesn't pull away and she keeps sinking deeper in the mud!! That is what she did in her choice of English coaching in class 9 then the teacher who molested her and then her current boss who literally takes advantages of her excellent professional skills to make the most for his firm and gives all the credit to his daughter who basically is a show baby and keeps taking the credit for Di's work and is mean to her. Obviously my sister is not happy with her life but you know who is responsible for that? She herself. And hey I am not being apathetic, I tried helping but nobody listened to me. They all kept sending her back to the boss because he was helping her bear the coaching fees for her accountancy studies. And for a few lac rupess they gave away her mental peace. And she herself is not ready to listen a word against her boss, what am I supposed to make sense of that? If a man is exploiting you what should you do? Leave or stay and worship him. And then if the latter is what you choose then why divulge yourself onto your family when you have bad mood? Go bear it yourself. You sow, so _you_ should reap, why us?! 
You know why I broke up with Voldemort? Because, that relationship was affecting my family. Her tensions and stress was bleeding in my family ties and that to me was unacceptable. If my life was a living hell then it should have stayed with me. Why should my mother and sister suffer for it. You know what Voldemort did once? So, I broke up with her after a fight and the next day, she shows up at my doorstep crying. I am not there, so my mom is shushing her asking what happened and she says she didn't sleep all night. Mom didn't know about our relationship and just knew that we were friends. Suspecting something, she had high BP for days.  Literally, days. Wtf! How can people not understand the term boundaries. How do people not know their limits. I wasn't taught these. You weren't taught these. These limits are basically logic. Are they demented? Mad? Insane? Can they not understand what's right or wrong?
5/10/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: But I do like celebrating birthdays and I have nice memories from attending other people's birthday parties and helping throwing them
5/10/19, 12:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Honestly, I haven't planned anything because I was expecting too much from myself. How about this, can we please celebrate your birthday on 13 July? Please?
5/10/19, 12:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a Saturday
5/10/19, 12:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There are multiple benefits, we will be together, we will be together, we will be together and basically we will be together
5/10/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At first, I thought I shouldn't rant like this. But then I realized barring my emotional reaction. All this is important information and that's why I wanted to tell you all this. And Shona, I will always tell you all this🙂
5/10/19, 12:28 AM - Shona 😍: If someone doesn't want to be helped they can't be helped. And by that I mean that if they don't see it themselves what they're doing wrong even if you point it out to them there's not much more you can do. What it comes to Sukriti (I still don't know if that's how it's spelled but I don't feel like calling her Voldemort), I really don't know what was her situation. But sometimes people don't know the boundaries. Or they have learned different boundaries. Or then they feel so hurt they can't think straight. But I guess if that's a recurring thing and if someone else lacking the sense of boundaries or reason is hurting you in turn, then maybe it's best to let those people go, if it's up to you to choose. Of course with family members it can be a whole other thing. But I think then making your own boundaries clear with them is the way to go.
5/10/19, 9:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby

5/10/19, 2:14 PM - Shona 😍: It definitely is............
5/10/19, 2:14 PM - Shona 😍: It's no good
5/10/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you afraid of me?
5/10/19, 2:14 PM - Shona 😍: And I just ordered some books too 🙈
5/10/19, 2:14 PM - Shona 😍: No baby
5/10/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/10/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You make me smile. ❤
5/10/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are love darling. You are simply out of the world
5/10/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are my life.
5/10/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can talk to you 24*7
5/10/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can adore you 24*7
5/10/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I like playing with you
5/10/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As if you were my barbie
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I like dressing you up
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Talking to you
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Playing with you
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And so many things
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I can't even say
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I'm not gonna ignore the other sweet stuff, that's sweet
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Shona 😍: But
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just wish we had a doll house😁
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Shona 😍: 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
5/10/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So?
5/10/19, 2:17 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not a doll
5/10/19, 2:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Sorry. Before it goes out of hand
5/10/19, 2:17 PM - Shona 😍: 😝
5/10/19, 2:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You need to stop thinking like an object
5/10/19, 2:17 PM - Shona 😍: Well you're the one who called me an object
5/10/19, 2:18 PM - Shona 😍: I'm also kidding rn
5/10/19, 2:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What I mean by that is that you are very adorable and dear to me like barbies are to little kids. You are so dear to me that I will start crying if anyone says anything to you, plays with you or calls you theirs. By comparison did not mean that you are a show off object of any sorts
5/10/19, 2:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is what I fear that someday, unknowingly I will say something like that and then you will just be very mad and I will feel helpless.☹ At first I wrote that you will leave me but then I realized we are past that 🙃
5/10/19, 2:21 PM - Shona 😍: But even if I'm kidding, I don't think that's a nice way too look at it. Comparing me to a toy kids play with, no matter how dear they are to the kids. Toys are there just for the kids and they don't have their own will.
5/10/19, 2:24 PM - Shona 😍: Well then I will be mad and then we will have an argument. But I believe we will be fine. Because I know you love me and I know I love you so we will work around it.
5/10/19, 2:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have told you this before, when I make comparisons, I only mean those to the extent I think them. When I say you are my Moon and sun I don't think that what I am saying is that your body composition is SiO2 or He and H2. What I mean is that you are the light in my life. Similarly, I didn't say that you are every thing that the toy is, I'm just saying that as the toys are dear to children and inseparable so you are to me.
5/10/19, 2:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
5/10/19, 2:25 PM - Shona 😍: Okay. I still didn't like this one ☺
5/10/19, 2:26 PM - Shona 😍: I'd rather be H2 and He 😬
5/10/19, 2:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it is the category
5/10/19, 2:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah I figured
5/10/19, 2:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it's settled
5/10/19, 2:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are my He and H2 😗
5/10/19, 2:27 PM - Shona 😍: ☀
5/10/19, 2:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For a minute I thought did she not like this one as well? Why is she quiet and then I realized oh she was hunting for the emoji😬
5/10/19, 2:27 PM - Shona 😍: :D exactly
5/10/19, 2:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/10/19, 2:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What can I do for you?
5/10/19, 2:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean
5/10/19, 2:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is there anything that I can do for you?
5/10/19, 2:30 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know. But what I know is that what I need to do for me and you is to get started with studying, for heaven's sake.
5/10/19, 2:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: . I feel like the last sentence.
5/10/19, 2:30 PM - Shona 😍: Why kulta?
5/10/19, 2:31 PM - Shona 😍: Or should I just leave it for tomorrow
5/10/19, 2:31 PM - Shona 😍: Go to the library
5/10/19, 2:31 PM - Shona 😍: I was planning to finish the studying for the week today
5/10/19, 2:32 PM - Shona 😍: I got up late. Mum joined me again at breakfast.
5/10/19, 2:32 PM - Shona 😍: I started doing everything else
5/10/19, 2:33 PM - Shona 😍: No actually I will not feel good about it if I do.
5/10/19, 2:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know. I just want to be there and kneel and absorb your warmth and feel safe in your love and safe shelter. I feel so liberated darling. I feel you have freed me from all my vices. You have helped me pulll myself out of the mud I was rotting in. I will be indebted to you all my life. Take me for I am yours and I will always be and thence I kneel unto you with all my power and might for the man that I am, I wouldn't have been, if not for you. Thank you for being in my life Shona and filling it with love affection and H2 and He
5/10/19, 2:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you should study good two hours today and enjoy the day. You have earned yourself this leisure with all your hard work and planning
5/10/19, 2:34 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to say
5/10/19, 2:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Try Fuck off. 🤣🤣🤣
5/10/19, 2:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously. 🤣
5/10/19, 2:36 PM - Shona 😍: You confuse me
5/10/19, 2:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you enlighten me. What's the point 🤪
5/10/19, 2:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know you are holding your head rn
5/10/19, 2:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Telling yourself
5/10/19, 2:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: _this_ is what I have gotten myself into😁
5/10/19, 2:37 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
5/10/19, 2:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you. BTW.  I would love to sing more for you. So please find me songs that you like and I can sing. I will kill you if you give me a Sia song
5/10/19, 2:38 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Sia song it is
5/10/19, 2:38 PM - Shona 😍: I'm kidding
5/10/19, 2:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to. If that's what you want then
5/10/19, 2:40 PM - Shona 😍: Will you excuse me now
5/10/19, 2:41 PM - Shona 😍: If I get started
5/10/19, 2:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Y.e.s.
5/10/19, 2:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please

5/10/19, 3:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/10/19, 3:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please stop buying books there. Or if you want to then compare the price with that in India. I think you can get it for much cheaper in here
5/10/19, 3:43 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah I thought about it. But I thought I'd like to read some before I get there
5/10/19, 3:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah baby. But just don't overspend. Money is precious and boredom is vicious
5/10/19, 3:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Which ones btw?
5/10/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I sometimes am surprised how I am able to rhyme so effortlessly. I find it very hot about myself 🙈and I would love to know what you think about it 🙂
5/10/19, 3:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hot because I think it's very British of me that I have good English skills and also I feel it's somehow related to my IQ and intelligence
5/10/19, 5:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok i just realized how narcissistic is that
5/10/19, 5:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/10/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay!
5/10/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But seriously how did the professor give me a C

5/10/19, 5:55 PM - Shona 😍: 😳
5/10/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is why I took his course
5/10/19, 5:55 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaaa
5/10/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Probably that's also why I took him for granted
5/10/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And suffered

5/10/19, 5:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I failed twice

5/10/19, 6:03 PM - Shona 😍: Exactly.
5/10/19, 6:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I didn't expect an A in introduction to psychology and undergraduate project
5/10/19, 6:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know how the exam went and when I submitted my work
5/10/19, 6:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it was a 50 50 chance that I could have got an A

5/10/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to say 😅 sure it's nice
5/10/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: Also I think books are a good way to spend money and they fight the boredom too 😬
5/10/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: I was thinking about July too, do you have any friends there I could hang out with during the days when you're working or should I find something myself? Like people from couchsurfing or some volunteer stuff?

5/10/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: Someone needs to restrain me
5/10/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: Before I spend all my savings before the exam
5/10/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I went a bit overboard with the books 😅
5/10/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: I mean they're all great books
5/10/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: But...
5/10/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: It was kind of impulsive
5/10/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you can still cancel them?
5/10/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When can we talk on call?
5/10/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: Well yeah..
5/10/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: I'll try to be fast in Jumbo
5/10/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: But I wanna sleep early so I can get up early
5/10/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: So many people studying for entrance exams there are no good spots left at the library if I go late
5/10/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😌
5/10/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok ma'am
5/10/19, 10:34 PM - Shona 😍: So ummm. You want me to live with 5 other dudes?
5/10/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is that how you are going to talk to me for the rest of our lives?
5/10/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If yes we can talk later and meanwhile you can think what's wrong with it and if no then I am more than willing to reply if you re write it in a better way
5/10/19, 10:44 PM - Shona 😍: Shona. I just meant it as an opener for a conversation.
5/10/19, 10:44 PM - Shona 😍: Nothing more.
5/10/19, 10:45 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry if it came off as... I don't know what?
5/10/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 1) mind your tone.
2) obviously, it involves the two of us so I didn't decide anything for you
3) in India unmarried couples are not allowed to live together so it's hard to find a place. So either we won't find one or we will have to pay a lot
4) this place is a 3 bhk and 6 people Will share the rent and they will give us our room which will be very convenient and I will have lived in the room for one month by then so I will have settled in and you will have no difficulty finding your fit
5) India is a unsafe place and hence I don't want to leave you alone when I am off to work and you may need something when I am not around and you may need help so yeah I will prefer if  we had some company 
6) They are really cool guys and you will love their company.
5/10/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry for the tone part
5/10/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I took it in a negative way
5/10/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I see. I didn't know what to think about it, hence the... clumsy opener. I also found it a bit funny so it was also meant in a funny way too.
5/10/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok darling. You may be the past conversations were playing on my mind in which you did not mean what you said in a funny way
5/10/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *you may be kidding. The past...
5/10/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah I get it. It's hard to tell the tone sometimes
5/10/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you worried?
5/10/19, 10:55 PM - Shona 😍: I'm kinda curious. I do like my own space but it's interesting to be with other people too. I wouldn't be worried here, I just didn't know how it is there and how the other people would feel about me being there. But I'm used to male company too, during my theology studies I seemed to hang out more with guys than girls 🤔
5/10/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: We can continue this discussion later too when we get closer to July and you have settled in. There is still the option of me getting a different place for myself, I can pay for that
5/10/19, 11:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can rent our own place. It will just cost us more and we will have to make our own room in it and by that I mean there are many little things that are needed. I don't mind  doing that it would have been nice for you and I think it would have been lively? Being with people from a different country. Obviously then there are different things that when so many people live together, its easier to hire a cook. That cook would have made food and you would have enjoyed each meal because afterall it's a different cuisine for you. And then as opposed to that we will have to worry daily about our food and ordering here and there and from my experience I can tell you that it sure as hell is not pleasant to worry about each and every meal.
5/10/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: Good points
5/10/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe lively would indeed be better and a completely new experience for me
5/10/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been thinking a lot about it and I think it will be better to live with them. I have thought this through and I am more than willing to discuss but as you pointed out in the relationship in the starting and something that I have learned the hard way that I am never going to decide for you. As an Indian who lives in such a close family, I often decide things for them, and I like that but I know my boundaries in the relationship and I know you don't like when others decide for you so I haven't decided, I just think it's the more favorable option. I will always be open to discussions and changes.
5/10/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah. I don't think we need to decide it yet. Both options have their own pros and cons. But that does sound like a good option too, living with other people. And I didn't think you had decided it for us, maybe because as you pointed out, that's not how I'm used to doing things and I've told it to you too. I mean with such important decisions.
5/10/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmmm
5/10/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Huhu
5/10/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry baby
5/10/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: You got worked up?
5/10/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For this
5/10/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm well I could've been more tactful
5/10/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: I love you and I need to keep reminding myself that you do think things through. Sometimes I'm just not sure when you announce things without explanations, so then I need to ask.
5/10/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just thought you are misunderstanding me again and it broke my heart. Darling 🥺 I don't know if you know this but I have not loved anyone more. And I don't think I have it in me to love anyone more. All my life I have loved someone for something back, usually intimacy but I don't think I have any selfish motives in this relationship. I am transcending my limits and using all my energy and might to love you but it just breaks my heart to see when you doubt me and if I feel that my love or my loyalty or devotion to you is being questioned. I rever you Babu. I always want what's the best for you. No less. I am sorry may be I did get a little too worked up but these may have been the reasons.
5/10/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand that train of thought and feelings. I love you too rakas and I couldn't ask anything more of you. I try to be more considerate with my words when it comes to the more sensitive topics.
5/10/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well don't stress about it
5/10/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to be careful and all
5/10/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was simply a misunderstanding
5/10/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it was not at all a sensitive topic
5/10/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In this case we can blame it to chance and the context
5/10/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What you can ensure is...
5/10/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you can stop doubting me? Stop the negative thoughts?
5/10/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For eg, in this case you were just trying to start a conversation but to me it seemed like you are saying that-

Do you want me to live with five other guys? Do you not know me? That I can't live with them? Do you not know that I like my privacy? I am coming to India to live with you and the only house you could find was with five other people‽ You know how much I want to live alone and become conscious around others and get you couldn't find a private setting?
5/10/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: Oh baby baby baby
5/10/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, a very very important piece of information, the walls in India are brick and mortar so you can have screaming sex inside and the person in the next room or outside won't know.
5/10/19, 11:32 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow I'm out of words and emojis
5/10/19, 11:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it could have been a possibility, certainly a probable one at least before our Sunday conversations. Because that is how some of our conversations were in which you were being negative
5/10/19, 11:34 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe so.
5/10/19, 11:34 PM - Shona 😍: .
5/10/19, 11:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not sure why
5/10/19, 11:35 PM - Shona 😍: Me neither
5/10/19, 11:35 PM - Shona 😍: Funny day again
5/10/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In response to this?
5/10/19, 11:35 PM - Shona 😍: I'm getting a bit sleepy too
5/10/19, 11:35 PM - Shona 😍: ?
5/10/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/10/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you out of words and emojis in response to this?
5/10/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it was your birthday. 🤪😁
5/10/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you get any gifts?
5/10/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: I have been negative in many past situations, that's true. With my opening today I felt many different things. I was kind of amused, kind of not sure what all you had thought. But I was sure we could discuss it and be fine
5/10/19, 11:38 PM - Shona 😍: Not yet... We're gonna celebrate with the family tomorrow
5/10/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: C
Great!❤❤❤
5/10/19, 11:40 PM - Shona 😍: Shona I should start preparing stuff for tomorrow
5/10/19, 11:40 PM - Shona 😍: And btw
5/10/19, 11:40 PM - Shona 😍: I was crazy fast with Jumbo 😬
5/10/19, 11:40 PM - Shona 😍: I was done with the whole thing in about an hour
5/10/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: Out of the door and back
5/10/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😱😨😱😨😱😨😵😵😵🥴🥴🥴🥴🤩🤩🤩🤓😎
5/10/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How long before you sleep?
5/10/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And C stands for convenient
5/10/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: I'll sleep within an hour
5/10/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good.
5/10/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: What was convenient?
5/10/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Celebrating it tomorrow instead of today
5/10/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
5/10/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
5/11/19, 12:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby

5/11/19, 12:27 AM - Shona 😍: I love you too shona ❤
5/11/19, 12:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤩
5/11/19, 12:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Have a spoon for me and try making the face that I would have made. 🤪
5/11/19, 12:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Send me selfies
5/11/19, 12:36 AM - Shona 😍: Sorry I already finished
5/11/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: Also I'm not quite sure what that was like 🤔
5/11/19, 12:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
5/11/19, 12:41 AM - Shona 😍: Shona
5/11/19, 12:41 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
5/11/19, 12:41 AM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna sleeeeeeep
5/11/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby
5/11/19, 4:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Today we were shopping study lamps for my sister and I remembered yours  and I was able to make a more informed decision. Well thats not the point. Well, when it came to pay for the bil, only I had the money at the time with me so I pulled out my wallet but I don't know why I just didn't directly pay to the shopkeeper but instead I handed over the money to Maa. 
Now a little sidestep from the story, in our culture you never take out your wallet infront of your elders. It is considered rude and a statement that you are showing off your money to your elders, who in turn were the enablers to be what you are and in turn they are the reason you are earning that money so you are advised not to pull out your wallet. 

So what happened was that she didn't bring hers so I had to pull mine out and help her. So I did. But then I realized that all my life I have been rejecting this etiquette which makes sense but I never know what was the alternative but today I came to know. That if you really want to pay then you quietly submit the money to the elders and let them pay. 
Now, why am I telling you all this. For that we will have to take a little sidestep again.

I asked myself a question a long long time ago that why do we follow manners and etiquettes. And the answer I will give but with an example. I used to wonder that why is it that we should not keep our arms on the dining table? And specifically our elbows. We can rest the bone on the edge but can't keep our elbows on the top, why? What's so wrong with that and why is it so that only the things inconvenient and hard to follow are in turn moulded into mannerisms and etiquettes? And I didn't agree to the norms/etiquettes until I found an answer. 
Our table manners are mainly British and in a classic dining setting in the old times, a table was full of so much food and crockery that there was hardly any room for that on the top, and people in turn if were to keep their elbows on the table, they would have created more crunch of space.  And hence the rule came to be. 
Similarly, many such etiquettes are a blessing in disguise but unfortunately from the past times so what I do instead is look at each one critically and it's applicability in my life and only if I find it useful I use it. For eg opening the door for a lady. I have a sister and I understand that sometimes you can be a little weak in the knees and it can be hard to open some doors with hydraulic hinges. Which can otherwise be very convenient for man to handle. So what people take as chivalrous is just pure reasonable judgement to me.



Sooooo, that was the sidestep. The point of the sidestep being that I just don't agree to norms or manners or etiquettes without critically experiencing them and seeing them first hand like in the wallet case. 


Now comes the main question, why am I telling you all this. 

Like today in that eureka moment I realized that yes! That's the correct thing to do. And that is how I will do it all my life. People crave for such moments all their life.  Moments such as these can be life defining and a series of such moments can be a bliss. But my question to you is that how will you feel if your life is only made up of such moments? In which every moment is so lucid that with every passing instant things seem to fall in place? And by in place I just don't mean good or excellent by that I mean that it could not be better, things are happening how they were supposed to in life or how they should be in life. And I love to tell you Shona ever since you have come in my life, it seems like you are the only thing it needed. It is like you are the Alco CEO who is cleansing me of my bad habits. You are the manner or the etiquette that just happened and seems to answer life long questions of my daily functioning and don't be mistaken it's not that these things are happening in one or two categories but it is changing my entire life. Let me quote an example. As you know, I am not a man of few words. If anything I am a man of millions of words :p
But before you I don't think I made much sense when I spoke. I mean I did but I was not impactful in my communication because I never thought through before speaking but ever since I have met you I have had this control over my words which has helped me gain a sense of achievement in itself. And believe me it's a Keystone thingy. Think about it, in order to speak effectively, I have to think clearly and in order to that I  have to focus all the time and generally this focus bleeds on to other domains of life and in turn makes me more attentive and aware of my circumstances and situation. I feel I am in control of my life. Something that I have not had in a very long while. ❤❤❤ And as I said, when you happened to me, this focus happened to me and I never realized until today that life just clicked and now that I realize it, it comes with the enlightenment that this is indeed the correct _manner_ of living life. :)
And all that because of you. I would have never been disciplined enough in my life to develop such focus in life. 
I can quote numerous examples but my thumbs are starting to yield so I will quote you just one more.
Take for eg the porn thing. If not for you I had tried multiple times before you to leave porn and failed. Failure was so inevitable that after a point I just started believing that I cannot live this life without it. And then you came and magically the danger waned off forever! But then again that's not the point, the point is that until today I never realized that you Shona babu are the reason why all this happened and now that it has happened it _clicks_ with the manner life should be. 
Reading, side jobs, grit, schedule, compassion, there are so many ways I have learned so much from you as to how life should be lived. Its funny how I much I grew up after meeting you and how big a fool I was to think that I am mature. If not for you, my life would have been that of an imp- devoid of courtesy and insights.


Anywhos, maybe someday I will get a click on how to celebrate birthdays but until then let this message suffice for this one. Let it be my wish to you on your Birthday. I am happy that we both are happy and I wish it stays that way. Happy birthday Shona. What can I gift my beloved anything that is equal  in any scale to the manners of life which she has taught me. I will desperately look for that gift but until then Happy Birthday darling. <3 m
May God bless you with all his might and take away all your plight. So that when you woke up after this night, may you also feel that life feels right. (:
5/11/19, 4:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe the fact that everything is in the right manner and  as it should be can be gauged from the fact that my life is so perfect rn that I can't seem to find a possibility of any adversity of any kind for the near future and let me tell you, it has not happened before. 
I went to a astrologer yesterday and he told me that it's not a good time rn for me and that I may have difficulty sleeping. I came out from there, laughed off and went back home. Thinking, that I have you. The man doesn't even know how happy I am and how well I sleep each day after talking to you and typing such long messages.
Good morning baby. 🙂
5/11/19, 4:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thank you for being mine. It is really an honour to call you that. ❤
5/11/19, 9:37 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning shona. Oh my. I'm gonna need some more time to reply to that ☺
5/11/19, 9:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hope you liked it 🙂
5/11/19, 10:38 AM - Shona 😍: I did ❤
5/11/19, 10:41 AM - Shona 😍: 🥰🥰🥺
5/11/19, 10:55 AM - Shona 😍: Shona I'm gonna have to reply to that later today. If I get into it now I will just feel all warm and fuzzy and I don't know if I can reach my work mode then 🤭😊🥰😚🤗
5/11/19, 10:56 AM - Shona 😍: Also that's a cool pic!
5/11/19, 11:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂
5/11/19, 1:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂
5/11/19, 1:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When will you be fre?
5/11/19, 1:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *free
5/11/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: Not sure. I'll do some more revision. I also need to vacuum at home and maybe do the cleaning at the office because tomorrow is the mother's day 🤔 and Laura comes in the evening and we celebrate my birthday
5/11/19, 2:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok baby
5/11/19, 4:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you. 🥺
5/11/19, 4:33 PM - Shona 😍: I was just thinking about you
5/11/19, 4:33 PM - Shona 😍: And us
5/11/19, 4:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Me too but in a different way and some very odd colors
5/11/19, 4:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😬
5/11/19, 4:35 PM - Shona 😍: What does that mean?
5/11/19, 4:35 PM - Shona 😍: You high again?
5/11/19, 4:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/11/19, 4:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No baby!
5/11/19, 4:36 PM - Shona 😍: :D
5/11/19, 4:36 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
5/11/19, 4:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking about us in a more erotic way😚
5/11/19, 4:36 PM - Shona 😍: Uh huh
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you done with studying?
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Shona 😍: Yea
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And what were you thinking about?
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Shona 😍: Hey shona
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Shona 😍: Just a sec
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes darling?
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Shona 😍: Dad got back home
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Shona 😍: Gotta help with groceries
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. 😌
5/11/19, 4:37 PM - Shona 😍: Not gonna take long
5/11/19, 4:44 PM - Shona 😍: Okkkk
5/11/19, 4:45 PM - Shona 😍: Done
5/11/19, 4:49 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm actually same stuff that you. I was reading a blog and ended up reading another and a post about bdsm sex. It was a nice article but somehow I've been feeling all weird today and it made me feel even more weird and I almost cried for I don't know what relief or anxiety or what. I've been feeling like someone's sitting on my chest and choking me (lol not related to the bdsm 😅).
5/11/19, 4:50 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I'm feeling weird because I had really bad dreams
5/11/19, 4:51 PM - Shona 😍: I wasn't even sure if that was last night but sometime during the day I just remembered a night when that happened
5/11/19, 4:51 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe that was last night
5/11/19, 4:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please tell me about the dreams shona. Let me psychoanalyse you 😁
5/11/19, 4:52 PM - Shona 😍: I don't remember details. It was just this horrible feeling of not being able to escape something
5/11/19, 4:53 PM - Shona 😍: And then I tried to pray so that it would go away
5/11/19, 4:53 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think it did
5/11/19, 4:53 PM - Shona 😍: It just kept coming back
5/11/19, 4:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you used weird two times and never really named the emotion in this message. The word weird to me is a generic word and can mean a lot of things. Can you please be a little specific?
5/11/19, 4:54 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. Uncomfortable. Anxious.
5/11/19, 4:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤔 ok. And you think are you are still fearing it? Even after you have woken up?
5/11/19, 4:55 PM - Shona 😍: No.
5/11/19, 4:55 PM - Shona 😍: But somehow the feeling remains?
5/11/19, 4:55 PM - Shona 😍: Like something's wrong with me
5/11/19, 4:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby.
5/11/19, 4:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But there is something wrong with you.
5/11/19, 4:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are in looooove
5/11/19, 4:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Isn't the whole world of yours supposed to be upside down rn?
5/11/19, 4:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
5/11/19, 4:56 PM - Shona 😍: Not helpful
5/11/19, 4:56 PM - Shona 😍: Then I read about psychosis
5/11/19, 4:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤨
5/11/19, 4:58 PM - Shona 😍: 😶😶😶😶😶
5/11/19, 4:58 PM - Shona 😍: Life is really weird (hmm. Stressful? Lot is changing, lot of uncertainty...) atm
5/11/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe it's the exam
5/11/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: Partially it is
5/11/19, 4:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you had a bad dream and so because of that you didn't feel fine. So instead of talking to someone you start reading articles that inflate is the problem and then you felt more anxious?
5/11/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: And then July
5/11/19, 4:59 PM - Shona 😍: I only remembered the bad dream later in the day
5/11/19, 5:00 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't know what to do with that
5/11/19, 5:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No it's not it's not stressful, it's not changing and it's not uncertain. You are labeling it
5/11/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: I disagree.
5/11/19, 5:03 PM - Shona 😍: Many things are about to change in my life. I don't know where I'll be th enext Fall. I've never been to India before and I have obviously never lived with you there
5/11/19, 5:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it doesn't matter now. It passed and I don't think you need a plan for your day dreaming about your night dreaming. 
What you can do is ignore it and actually reason with yourself that it's your imagination. For eg I had a dream in the morning that I got a stain on my white formal suite. I was stressed as hell but then I realized oh wait a second, it's a dream and I don't even have a white suit. So I changed the color to what I want and went to a celebrity party that I threw in split second and in which everyone was present 😁
5/11/19, 5:05 PM - Shona 😍: This dream is actually a recurring thing. I haven't dreamt of it in quite a while. But the feeling is similar in these dreams
5/11/19, 5:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry but I am starting to lose sight here. I am not able to empathize with you as to who and hence I am not able to think of a solution. 🙁
5/11/19, 5:07 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah. Well it is just a dream. Maybe the meaningful thing here is how I feel a bit uncertain about the future
5/11/19, 5:08 PM - Shona 😍: I know that will pass too
5/11/19, 5:08 PM - Shona 😍: But today I've been feeling it
5/11/19, 5:18 PM - Shona 😍: You're not able to empathize so you're just gonna leave me alone with it in the middle of a conversation? I wasn't asking for a solution.
5/11/19, 5:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry I didn't leave
5/11/19, 5:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I dosed off
5/11/19, 5:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't realize it
5/11/19, 5:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slept only 3 hours in the night
5/11/19, 5:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I just came back home. So the AC felt really good
5/11/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/11/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just saw something
5/11/19, 5:41 PM - Shona 😍: K
5/11/19, 6:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have not seen you write that in a while
5/11/19, 6:29 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
5/11/19, 6:29 PM - Shona 😍: I'm writing something else
5/11/19, 7:28 PM - Shona 😍: Your message had plenty of content (or words, yes, you are indeed a man of millions of words. And I will always prefer that to a man of few words. Maybe because I’m more like that myself. And the men I grew up with were that too. So to me it’s delightful that you are good with words. Not just delightful but actually essential. I have sworn to myself at times in the past that I want to be with a man who can freely talk and express his emotions. If I were to be with a man at all. There have been times when I’ve thought (very unfairly) that all men are awful and they’re only gonna hurt me if I let them close. And at the same time I’ve been desiring for someone to come and prove me wrong in that. Well this went on a tangent big time.). 

About the manners. I think you told me the you-shouldn’t-keep-your-elbows-on-the-table -example earlier when you were here. I get the point of assessing the manners or etiquettes yourself and keeping the ones you find sensible yourself. I think that’s usually a good approach. Although in some instances it’s probably better to keep the manners if it’s very important to the other people involved. And in multicultural settings the etiquettes might not even be very clear. That brings to my mind that we are probably gonna have multiple instances when the other does something that’s considered rude or ill-mannered in the other culture, when with our relatives for example. But let’s not worry about that yet :D What it comes to opening doors for other people, I think it’s a nice thing to do to anyone. Sometimes I do it myself to women or men, if it seems a nice thing to do in a particular situation.

I’m glad you feel that my presence in your life has been such good influence. I truly am. After we just stopped talking after I told about my nightmare I started to listen to a podcast. It’s the same podcast given by the Finnish actor I mentioned a while back. Somehow listening to him is very soothing. He seems to have a very practical and deromanticised view on life. Sometimes even cynical. But it is relieving in a sense. In this episode he said that there’s gonna be chaos in life, no matter what. There are gonna be those happy moments too, but mostly life is just dealing with bullshit. Now that might sound very negative, but that’s just his style. He’s not actually that cynical and he gives good advice too. The podcast is actually about people sending him questions about their life, things that they’re struggling with at the moment. Anyway. He mentioned an example from his own life. In Finland there’s this one acting school and it’s ridiculously difficult to get in. The most difficult of the Universities in fact, smaller percentage gets selected than to med school, engineering or law school. So in that sense it’s the most difficult one. But what he said was that before getting in, he thought that just getting in would bring him this peace. That somehow after that his life will be figured out and everything will work out easily. But life doesn’t work like that and it didn’t bring him peace. New struggles keep coming, and that’s just life. That made me feel better about my life at the moment too. Getting into med school will not fix everything. The struggles will just be different, and that’s life. There will be moments of joy and happiness too, but the final rest we will only get when we die. In the end of the podcast a friend of the actor told about his terminal cancer and the questions he’s dealing with about life and death. That in turn reminded me of how fragile life ultimately is.  When I left the library earlier and I wasn’t feeling very good I actually thought why the hell do I need to be a human. Why can’t I just be plankton or something. And after talking with you and listening to the podcast I’m quite happy again that I am a human. Even if at times being one feels empty and meaningless and lonely. The happy and joyful moments will come too. And I’ve found that those moments of the deepest joy come with other people. 

Another thing that the friend talking about death reminded me of. At times I think that I can actually die happy if I were to die now. Okay maybe happy is a wrong word, and I definitely wouldn’t want to die yet and it would be horrible and tragic and everything. But somehow after meeting you and falling in love with you and getting to know you and getting to love you and being loved by you… Somehow it feels like I’ve already experienced something so meaningful in life that even if it were to end… I feel privileged to have experienced all that I have so far. 

All this reminded me of my friend, the one I’ve told you about, the one I said you reminded me of. I was talking to her about I don’t exactly remember of what. It had to do with purpose in life, and it was during a time when I wasn’t in a very good place, during the first year of my theology studies. She herself has gone some serious struggles in her own life, much more than I. But she just said that the purpose of life is love. And she was talking like it was obvious. Like, what else can it be? And I want to believe that. Not romantic love but love in its all forms. Love for one another. And oh my God is that difficult to remember or even believe at times. And most times it actually feels like it’s impossible to try to live by that and then the perfectionist mindset tries to take over. But I think trying is the point. Trying our best. It’s never gonna be perfect but it is the point of everything. 

Hmm. So somehow combining these two worldviews. Life is mostly just bullcrap and that the purpose of life is love. Wow. Somehow they both speak to me. Maybe they just make sense on different levels.
5/11/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For a change I am out of words m

5/12/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a task for you
5/12/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please please please sit them all down look em in the eye and tell them that. Make them realize how good it was and how they should do it more often. It's surprising how the best of these times can still go unnoticed  and unattended consciously. People enjoy it but fail to realize how much  and hence nobody ever pushes for them
5/12/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby?

5/13/19, 1:20 AM - Shona 😍: I mean I'm no one to talk I spend 150e on lingerie at once... This time I did return half of the stuff but at times I do. But I will always try to prefer quality over quantity, so that the things will last too. But budgeting. That way we can also buy the things we want that might not be completely necessary but something that we want and help us with our (every day) life. Like good gadgets might. I need to learn budgeting better too though. Anyhow. Kulta rakas dear darling. I should sleep. And so should you, it's LATE. 😬

5/13/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I dare you
5/13/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can't cry
5/13/19, 11:36 PM - Shona 😍: Too late
5/13/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/13/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please?
5/13/19, 11:40 PM - Shona 😍: ❤❤
5/13/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will tell you. It was a shitty weekend. I didn't do anything. Generally what happens mostly when I go home after long periods of time - like after my semester ends-  is that I engage myself in house chores and see it first hand that what all is up with things in the house and generally I do that to see if everything is functioning and that the family is not facing any issues. I did the same this time. Found pretty big things. A lot was to be cleaned and a lot of stuff need to be replaced. Especially the utensils in kitchen. Mom was using the same old shitty utensils for years but you know how much time it takes to vaccum the place with a broken vaccum right? That's the thing I had to counsel mom that she needs new tools. She spends three hours of her life in the kitchen daily and that she deserves them. Really I am motivating a lot of people these days.  It just comes naturally to me I guess. So we got new utensils for her on mother's day and she couldn't be happier.  The we had to throw out some of her old worn out clothes because she won't and then convince her to get new ones. All this because She hardly spends on herself. 

Then had to motivate my sister to study and see the therapist.  A lot of reparations in general. So it was taxing. Other than that, I didn't do anything. And I felt very bad about myself. I was bummed that I was not able to talk to you and I felt like you didn't need me either. So I just felt like I had nothing to do. So I Youtubed for endless hours and then I got aroused by watching all the tech videos and now I have a long list of items to shop for. And hey, that helped me find gifts for you soooo it was good. J
5/13/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I could have typed all that in the last two days but it's not the same without you. It just feels like you are listening to me and then I feel motivated enough to write books on WhatsApp
5/13/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: ❤❤❤ That's so nice that you got the utensils and clothes for your mum. Why did you feel bad about yourself? You helped both your mum and sister!
5/13/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I know it's not the same
5/13/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry you feel it was shitty but to me indeed it sounds like you did good things. Is it just that you didn't enjoy them yourself? Or too much idle time?
5/13/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wasn't able to help my life, you.
5/13/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: Baby
5/13/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The latter and that I really really missed you.
5/13/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: 😭🥺 I missed you too rakas. This weekend was so packed! And it feels like we haven't spoken in ages on video call, properly
5/13/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will have plenty time tomorrow
5/13/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I moved out for you
5/13/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you can't complain
5/13/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: Are you going to Gurugram? To the apartment?
5/13/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not ❤

5/14/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In my recent trips(when I was high) I realized how much music can mean. I used the Bose qc25 for my stay in Finland and I just didn't want to return em. They were too good. I honestly don't like anything else anymore. There is a difference in listening to music and listening to music in the way it was intended too.
5/14/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My dream for you is to get high and listen to that pair with your favorite music on but lets postpone that.
5/14/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For now get the pair and please please please listen to Spotify
5/14/19, 12:02 AM - Shona 😍: Great headphones do make a difference. I think you only realize when you use such a pair

5/14/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: What is it Shona?
5/14/19, 11:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. Listen. It is fine. I am not going to lead you to a build up because honestly I suck at it so I am going to just directly say it. You have changed. Actually eveolved in this one year. I always judge my character by imagining myself as a father of a growing child. Will I be a proud father. And if it has increased, I feel I have matured to keep the wheel churning. I think I have certainly grown as opposed to myself last year and much of the reasons is your presence in my life. How I want to be like a good person. Like you. And that to me has given me maturity this year. Similarly if you were to look you will realize that you have matured too and it's because of the exam. I fail the exam or not I still have evolved as a person.
5/14/19, 11:55 AM - Shona 😍: Yes I have matured in the past year. A lot because of the exam, but also a lot because of being with you.
5/14/19, 11:55 AM - Shona 😍: Baby

5/15/19, 9:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok.
5/15/19, 9:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I remembered something that I will share with you. When I first got my shoulder dislocated. It was a very pinching pain and I didn't know at the time, what to do with myself. I just knew it was something serious and that it will hurt my dreams of playing for the team. I went to the doctor and he told me that it's serious and he told me I shouldn't play. He told me that it's not going to be good for my future as I may lose my arm. Then it was upto me, whether or not I want to play and you know what I chose. And the reason why I kept going was not because I had an ambition or anything but simply because my people needed me. I owed them my presence and my maximum amount of effort and that is what I did. 
You may face anything in the exam. It  can be easy and it can be tough but what I want you to know is that whenever you feel you are failing just point a finger at yourself and tell yourself that come on. Come on Hanna. You have to do it for yourself, and for your family. You can't fail them. Give it everything you have got. Everything. And believe me you have big guns with you so give it everything. I am proud of you with what you have achieved so far but I want you to tell me that you will give it everything. Promise!
5/15/19, 9:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hey. What do you do in the Battlefield? What you have learned during the training right? And you in your training have learned Grit. Efficient Grit. And I want you to have that in you. Grit. If a question is tough, you are tougher, if the paper is lengthy, be fast. And hey remember to not do silly mistakes. Try remembering your favorite song and try humming it's tune.
5/15/19, 9:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hey if you start panicking a lot, then just remember how Laura sat on you. Remember how she play flat and kissed you 😁😁😁😅😅😅

That's how much we all love you and we will pray for it to go well. Blessings never get wasted and it will not be wasted for your Shona. You will rock it today. No matter what happens today, we will always be proud of you. 💓
5/15/19, 9:40 AM - Shona 😍: I will give the exam my everything today. I promise.

5/16/19, 2:48 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm what should I ask
5/16/19, 2:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Am I?
5/16/19, 2:49 PM - Shona 😍: Yes ❤❤❤❤
5/16/19, 2:49 PM - Shona 😍: Why are you so cute? that's a question :D
5/16/19, 2:50 PM - Shona 😍: I feel like kissing you all over your face
5/16/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's an interesting one
5/16/19, 2:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🥰
5/16/19, 2:51 PM - Shona 😍: But I actually don't know if you have the answer
5/16/19, 2:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can try
5/16/19, 2:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is challenging but it will be nice.
5/16/19, 2:51 PM - Shona 😍: Or if it's about why I find you cute
5/16/19, 2:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. That's where the answer lies.
5/16/19, 2:53 PM - Shona 😍: There are plenty of different factors that contribute but rn it was you asking me to ask you questions and that you like it when I do that. Somehow that was really cute to me
5/16/19, 2:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: cute
/kjuːt/
 Learn to pronounce
adjective
1.
attractive in a pretty or endearing way.
"she had a cute little nose"
synonyms:	endearing, adorable, lovable, sweet, lovely, appealing, engaging, delightful, dear, darling, winning, winsome, charming, enchanting; More


So that is the meaning of cute. And the plain and simple answer is that I am not. I am just kind. I am your lover and I give everything of mine to you. This selfless act induces the same emotions of love and endearment. This emotion usually is followed by the demisexual ones. And then the other person seems attractive. 
It can also be largely affected by the fact that when I say somethings like asking you to ask questions, it automatically takes you back to some old memories probably from  childhood because kids are generally inquisitive so maybe you read that message in a childish way and you found it child like or cute. 💓
5/16/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: Well that was quite an analysis
5/16/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
5/16/19, 2:58 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I prefer not thinking about the reason :D
5/16/19, 2:59 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow takes the cuteness away
5/16/19, 2:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I qute you too🥰
5/16/19, 2:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
5/16/19, 2:59 PM - Shona 😍: 😁
5/16/19, 2:59 PM - Shona 😍: But now that I think of it I did have other questions in mind too
5/16/19, 2:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes please shoot
5/16/19, 3:00 PM - Shona 😍: Like with Laura we talked about differences in dating cultures in different countries, especially in India and Iran for obvious reasons
5/16/19, 3:00 PM - Shona 😍: Then I started to wonder how common is it that people actually date there
5/16/19, 3:00 PM - Shona 😍: And how much is arranged by the parents
5/16/19, 3:01 PM - Shona 😍: You have told me some
5/16/19, 3:01 PM - Shona 😍: But
5/16/19, 3:01 PM - Shona 😍: I'd like to know more
5/16/19, 3:02 PM - Shona 😍: Like what I remember is that the general attitude is that it's not really approved of or that it's frowned upon
5/16/19, 3:02 PM - Shona 😍: Dating
5/16/19, 3:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Depends on the area. Some are very conservative areas. Especially the villages. In the towns relationships are  more common. But even then you getting your parents consent is a very subjective thing. Obviously elite classes are fine with it. Middle classes not so much. A Hindu may be more fine with it. A Muslim not so much. Intercaste dating is often frowned upon by elders. Then there are relationships that you hide from everyone. Generally these days given a rough number from my experience, 80-90% women date.
5/16/19, 3:06 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmm. I see. Well seems very common then. Though your experience is from the town
5/16/19, 3:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/16/19, 3:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But Laura seems serious for this one?
5/16/19, 3:08 PM - Shona 😍: Well. As serious as it can be at this point I guess. But they have been talking for around a month
5/16/19, 3:08 PM - Shona 😍: Less actually
5/16/19, 3:09 PM - Shona 😍: But do people usually tell their parents, even if they would not get their approval
5/16/19, 3:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No they don't
5/16/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm okay
5/16/19, 3:20 PM - Shona 😍: I was also thinking about your sister
5/16/19, 3:21 PM - Shona 😍: That will she have a say in whom she's gonna marry, or if she even wants to marry at all?
5/16/19, 3:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She wants to marry yes
5/16/19, 3:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She will have a say yes
5/16/19, 3:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will make sure she has
5/16/19, 3:22 PM - Shona 😍: ❤
5/16/19, 3:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But she is not wise enough
5/16/19, 3:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will have to decide for her
5/16/19, 3:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hope Laura gets married soon.
5/16/19, 3:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She really can enjoy some company
5/16/19, 3:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It has been long since she was living alone.
5/16/19, 3:33 PM - Shona 😍: That's an interesting statement. I can kind understand what you mean based on what you've told recently
5/16/19, 3:33 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmmm
5/16/19, 3:33 PM - Shona 😍: True
5/16/19, 3:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Same goes for you though
5/16/19, 3:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😁😁
5/16/19, 3:35 PM - Shona 😍: Though I don't know how soon will that happen if she's serious with Farzad 😅
5/16/19, 3:35 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I haven't been living alone though
5/16/19, 3:36 PM - Shona 😍: Like really alone
5/16/19, 3:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That was not the point of the observation
5/16/19, 3:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤪

5/17/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To love you is a pleasure, 
Thus my joy has no measure.

To love you is a blessing.
It is but a curse so pressing.

It kills me daily and keeps me awake,
Yet fills me with life how can I spake.

Redeemed me it has from by past so bleak,
And I wouldn't stop on this winning streak

For a lifetime of happiness awaits us two
A little less sorrow and a joy blissfully true

So love you I will and will keep doing so
My babu my Shona I hope you know. ♥

I. am. so. glad. that you introduced me to Bhangra. And I am so glad that I ditched the gym and started to dance. I was so crappy in the beginning when I started but with practise it’s gotten easier and more and more fun!  Obviously there are tons of things where I can still improve and get better but it feel so good to see the growth from the very start. YAY. I want to keep dancing. I actually enjoy it more than theater. I didn’t have this feeling after the play when we had performed. Maybe it is the movement and the joy, theater is very different in that sense. Maybe I want to try Bollywood dance or even Kathak too <3 Hihi during the performance today maybe the most difficult part was to try to control my face! I was also crazy nervous so it was really difficult to try to smile with that, not to mention all the jumping!! Huhhuh. Well apparently you couldn’t really tell that from the audience, I really felt like I had this horrified look on my face with the nervousness :D What a day <3 And the new headphones are soooo goood!! I’ve been using them while listening to music. Baby please don’t worry about me not liking the gifts enough. I might not be the nicest person to gift something… Because if I really want something I usually get it for myself, so then it’s diffcult to say what do I wish for if other people ask me. Like this birthday I wanted to get the teeth whitening done, and I got almost half of the amount from my parents as a birthday gift. Well that’s not unusual, these days they tend to give money instead of buying us stuff for our birthdays anyway. Also, I probably would’ve got it done even without the contribution from my parents. Hmm. But maybe wishing for things from others is something for me to learn. Or maybe not, I don’t know if that needs to change actually. Anyhow. Kulta. It’s really sweet of you to think what I might like or benefit from, as I already said. I really appreciate it. For example, I certainly wouldn’t have got such headphones for myself, but oh boy they are nice to have and music sounds much better with them😊 Rakas. I hope your evening was good too. I hope you enjoyed the workout. Did you discuss the preparation with the seniors yet? Your poem was adorable too. But I’m not gonna write an analysis on it this time 😬 However I know that you pour your heart out into them and that's what make them so sweet to me. I love you Kunj Behari Beriwala. Good night. And good morning ☀
5/18/19, 6:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby, you did have a horrified look on your face. I could tell. I don't know if people could but I know you inside out. But it sure was funny to see you that way. And yet you made very few mistakes. Overall, all the jumping and dancing! I loved to see you do that. Hmm, let me see if I can learn Bhangra in these two months.  What a fun act will that be. I am telling you darling. If you were to dance with me, you will enjoy it much more. I really want to too. And hey, these appreciations for the gift don't count,  it's like the face Monica made when Rachel made the English trifle. That is because Laura told you! 😁😁😁
So, I don't know if this appreciation is authentic but hey, you have to, have to listen to good music on the headphones and then let me know. Until then I will wait. 😇
Also, please set up the speaker clock with the app. Find a YouTube video or something, it has a tonne of features and only then will you be able to appreciate it. 
Ok, I think I have said those two things too many times now 😅 so I will stop. 
But baby, it's not all about Bahngra. It's about what you have achieved in the last year. A relationship, theater, bhangra, and a med school prep. It's no small feat darling and we couldn't be more proud of you. You are a wonderful person and you deserve all of the gifts that we have given you. You have earned them yourself. Your efforts have been so significant in changing your life, did you notice that, how much you have changed as a person? I spent all my money on the exchange hunting for just that. These changes don't come easy and they sure have no limit to the price that one pays for them but please baby if you can sit with yourself and observe. Now that all the activities are over and everything is off your mind. You will be able to think more clearly. In the case you can let me know, I will feel privileged. 
And hey, I am glad to know that you are this happy, and I also want you to know that its not by chance that you are, you CREATED it for yourself. That's right, you and only you are responsible for this happiness darling. You invested yourself in the theater and dance classes with such a good preparation for the exam. It's no one but you who deserves the credit and thence the happiness that stems from it. And you have been so crazy disciplined in the past that now for good two three months you can enjoy your life and enjoy the time. And you will be only more happier. And hey, learn Bollywood. It's much much better. I am telling you. It's the best! It's only fun and crazy ass shit. There are no rules and there is no dance elegance it's just primal body movements. 😅 So I am sure you will like it. 

Hmm, other than that, you know how much I love you. Since you were having a nice time with Laura, I got some time to clear my head and write the poem for you. My day was super nice too. I went swimming and played 🥏. It was super nice. I fixed the scooty in the house so now I have a vehicle to roam about in town and saves me a lot of money from cabs and God saves me a lot of time as well . I also Went grocery shopping and ate street food in the afternoon 😍. Stood outside a mall and stared at a poster of a girl in Bikini totally creepy shit🤣🤣🤣 
Talked to my seniors about my placement preparation and it was great. A lot of work to be done and I will have to be very disciplined. I will probably have to keep my phone aside for a while. Especially if you are coming in July. We will discuss that at length though. Over all a very good day with very good vibes. Hey, and it rained and we ate the street food in the rain. We got wet and all in the rain and it was so good to bathe in the rain ♥♥ after so many days.!!! 
As I said, a very very satisfying day overall. Spoke to you in the afternoon and that was so special. Before that I completed my proposal. Found two accountability partners until now. One is my roommate and we are trying to stop abusing. so overall life is changing for good. Positive vibes are back. I am still taking the meds though, so it is all good. I could talk to you a little more. That's all that I wish from life but I totally understand that you have been busy and this is my way of showing support Shona. Good morning babu baby. I love you. I wish you have a great day ahead.

5/18/19, 11:22 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning rakas
5/18/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: Wow
5/18/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know where to start 😄
5/18/19, 11:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
5/18/19, 12:10 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I'm just gonna start with what you wrote about your day yesterday 😬 where did you go swimming? Do you have a pool there somewhere close? I'm glad you had such a good time too ☺ I'm seriously wondering if that's a good idea what you're trying with not touching yourself. Though it certainly is interesting and maybe it will work to some extent that it will get easier after a while. Or then not 😁 It probably doesn't work the same for men as for women but maybe it's not all different. As you know I was basically celibate for 22 years and I just didn't really think about sex much. Occasionally yes but not very much. So maybe when you don't do it you don't think about it either. Another thing that I'm thinking is that if you wait for 1.5 months you will not leave me alone for a second when I come there in July 😂

 About the placement preparation. I can imagine it will be intense, I guess I will just have to brace myself for that. But yes, please let's discuss it properly beforehand. Also yay you found accountability partners! I hope they're better than me at the job 😁 I'm glad you're still taking the meds and I think you should take them as the doctor advices, and if you're gonna stop then do it gradually as he said. Rakas. I mich you and I love you.
5/18/19, 12:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not leave you alone. But it takes two to tango. Would you want to leave me either?

5/18/19, 1:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Figuratively speaking this, the act of me not being able to meet him is an apparent landslide

5/18/19, 1:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For eg he makes me feel guilty if I am not able to devote time. For eg now. I told him I have plans in the evening and he said that he cancelled with everyone else because of me. What did I know. 🤷🏻‍♂
5/18/19, 1:51 PM - Shona 😍: Ah that's a pity. But yeah how could you have known if you didn't talk about it beforehand. I can understand if he feels bad though if he canceled his own plans though

And that just shuts me up with such topics, because it was about her. I'm not sure why I didn't understand it at the moment that that's what was holding me back. Well maybe next time I will know

5/19/19, 12:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's so natural and Intuitive and makes so much sense
5/19/19, 12:40 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds like you are really enjoying it
5/19/19, 12:40 PM - Shona 😍: I'm glad
5/19/19, 12:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will you?
5/19/19, 12:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe you can do that when you come here in July
5/19/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if I will need it
5/19/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: Crossed my mind too
5/19/19, 1:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So now we are thinking alike? 😍
5/19/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: But then I thought is that what I want to be doing during the day when I come all the way there 😬
5/19/19, 1:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why not. I mean if you have better things to do then no but if not then why not
5/19/19, 1:20 PM - Shona 😍: Yea
5/19/19, 1:25 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm maybe that could be my plan b. Though I don't know if just learning coding would be enough to get a job
5/19/19, 1:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it can be about interest. Yes Finding a job is a possibility but you will have to really invest yourself in coding for that which I don't think is necessary
5/19/19, 1:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry darling but I had to shave because I have office tomorrow and maintaining shapes is difficult as I don't really can shave well. So I  need to be ready for it and the moustache had to go. ☹🙁
5/19/19, 1:34 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmm
5/19/19, 1:35 PM - Shona 😍: Noooooo :D sexy stache is gone
5/19/19, 1:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>

5/19/19, 1:36 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
5/19/19, 1:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So?
5/19/19, 1:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You giving me ideas?
5/19/19, 1:36 PM - Shona 😍: I'm cleaning...
5/19/19, 1:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😇
5/19/19, 1:36 PM - Shona 😍: No😁
5/19/19, 1:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can always enjoy some nudity
5/19/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That was fast😍😍😍
5/19/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Omg
5/19/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want some?
5/19/19, 1:43 PM - Shona 😍: Well I'm not the one who gets aroused here 😁
5/19/19, 1:44 PM - Shona 😍: But little tantalizing is always nice
5/19/19, 3:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/19/19, 3:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/19/19, 3:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/19/19, 3:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Babyy
5/19/19, 3:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The tickets are for 50000 RS 😄
5/19/19, 3:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I checked
5/19/19, 3:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I need your passport number
5/19/19, 3:39 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaa? Yesterday it was 40000? What changed?
5/19/19, 3:39 PM - Shona 😍: I don't have it with me here
5/19/19, 3:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was the other way round
5/19/19, 3:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
5/19/19, 3:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Delhi to Helsinki

5/19/19, 3:40 PM - Shona 😍: 😄😄
5/19/19, 3:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't mind. It will be worth every penny.
5/19/19, 3:40 PM - Shona 😍: But now I'm thinking I might get it for cheaper?
5/19/19, 3:41 PM - Shona 😍: And actually I typed it so many times yesterday that I remember it by heart😂
5/19/19, 3:41 PM - Shona 😍: FP1394444
5/19/19, 3:41 PM - Shona 😍: I'm quite sure
5/19/19, 3:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
5/19/19, 3:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It doesn't matter
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will get reward points worth that money
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So.
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will be almost half the price
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Shona 😍: 😳😳😳
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What I mean to say is
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Shona 😍: That's quite something
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That it will cost 50000
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will get reward points worth 50000
5/19/19, 3:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So if we spend wisely
5/19/19, 3:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then we effectively get it for half the price.
5/19/19, 3:43 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
5/19/19, 3:43 PM - Shona 😍: Shona
5/19/19, 3:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sure we won't be able to shop for all the amount but we still will be able to cash some.
5/19/19, 3:43 PM - Shona 😍: Alrighty
5/19/19, 3:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes Mera shonu?
5/19/19, 3:44 PM - Shona 😍: I'm trying to finish by 2 because I will pick up Mikko from work so please let's continue this later!
5/19/19, 3:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok my baby
5/19/19, 3:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you.
5/19/19, 3:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ♥
5/19/19, 3:44 PM - Shona 😍: I love you
5/19/19, 3:44 PM - Shona 😍: 😚
5/19/19, 4:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How do you like the belly fat?
5/19/19, 4:50 PM - Shona 😍: Nice dick
5/19/19, 4:50 PM - Shona 😍: I would really like it inside me rn
5/19/19, 4:51 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry I was in a hurry at the office I didn't wanna watch them earlier 😬
5/19/19, 4:51 PM - Shona 😍: But apparently Mikko is home already he didn't need a ride
5/19/19, 4:52 PM - Shona 😍: Didn't really pay attention to it before you mentioned
5/19/19, 4:52 PM - Shona 😍: Only makes me think about your health now
5/19/19, 4:54 PM - Shona 😍: And one thing when I think about your health is that don't you dare to die before me 😅
5/19/19, 4:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ♥
5/19/19, 4:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not in the greatest of shapes but it has been worse
5/19/19, 4:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's ok shona
5/19/19, 4:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you happen to touch yourself then shoot some videos for me
5/19/19, 5:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a question
5/19/19, 5:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why do you write an intent for the day?
5/19/19, 5:11 PM - Shona 😍: It was actually an advice given on the Perfect day formula book. I found that it was quite helpful in planning the studying
5/19/19, 5:12 PM - Shona 😍: Doing the planning beforehand, and having it ready when I actually started the studying
5/19/19, 5:16 PM - Shona 😍: I'll keep that in mind
5/19/19, 5:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My next question was gonna be how you found it but apparently you can read my thoughts so..
5/19/19, 5:17 PM - Shona 😍: 😁
5/19/19, 5:17 PM - Shona 😍: Why did you ask?
5/19/19, 5:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mhmm.
5/19/19, 5:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was planning to start doing it myself with the placement preparation.
5/19/19, 5:18 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds like a great idea
5/19/19, 5:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because what I have seen with myself is that I don't think about my goals enough
5/19/19, 5:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then when I later see them
5/19/19, 5:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I realize how much I underestimated them
5/19/19, 5:18 PM - Shona 😍: I see
5/19/19, 5:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Accha listen
5/19/19, 5:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Puccha
5/19/19, 5:19 PM - Shona 😍: PUCCHA BACK
5/19/19, 5:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ui🙈
5/19/19, 5:19 PM - Shona 😍: Ui?
5/19/19, 5:20 PM - Shona 😍: Ui means swim in Finnish :D
5/19/19, 5:20 PM - Shona 😍: In addition to it being an exclamation
5/19/19, 5:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
5/19/19, 5:21 PM - Shona 😍: And why do you hide, are you scared of my pucchas?
5/19/19, 5:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shy
5/19/19, 5:27 PM - Shona 😍: I will drown you in pucchas
5/19/19, 5:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I will hide in your coat
5/19/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Where are you darling?
5/19/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you ok?
5/19/19, 7:41 PM - Shona 😍: I'm having lunch
5/19/19, 7:41 PM - Shona 😍: Gonna take Nelli out afterwards
5/19/19, 7:47 PM - Shona 😍: Something quite funny just happened. So I've occasionally worn your Jockey boxers as sleepwear. I had washed them and somehow they had ended up in dad's closet, apparently mum had mistaken them for his underwear. And he was like these are not mine, are they Mikko's? And then went to ask him and when Mikko said they weren't his I had to confess that they are yours and that I wear them at night sometimes 😂😂😂
5/19/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: I'm glad everyone else found it funny too, though maybe afterwards mum and dad will think of something... Oh well
5/19/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/19/19, 7:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it shouldn't be surprising to them I guess
5/19/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: I guess😅
5/19/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Apparently there is an issue with international flight booking on the platform. Let me see what I can I do tomorrow. I think it should fix itself. If not, then you can go ahead and do it from your side.
5/19/19, 8:23 PM - Shona 😍: Oh?
5/19/19, 8:23 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/19/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just hope it gets fixed
5/19/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will be a great bargain
5/19/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was the talk with the parents?
5/19/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What was it about?
5/19/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah!
5/19/19, 8:26 PM - Shona 😍: I will tell you later.
5/19/19, 8:59 PM - Shona 😍: Hey
5/19/19, 8:59 PM - Shona 😍: Did you figure out Python yet?
5/19/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah
5/19/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am working on it
5/19/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/19/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: 😙
5/19/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: Shonu please let me know if you want to talk at some point tonight
5/19/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: But I try to sleep by 10.30 as I gotta get up before 5am tomorrow
5/19/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 5am?
5/19/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been learning Python
5/19/19, 10:29 PM - Shona 😍: 4.45 probably
5/19/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's fun 😄
5/19/19, 10:30 PM - Shona 😍: That's so nice!
5/19/19, 10:32 PM - Shona 😍: How are you feeling about tomorrow?
5/19/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hopeful
5/19/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sure you'll be great!! And I really hope you will enjoy it ❤
5/19/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. Give me 20 mins.
5/19/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
5/19/19, 10:59 PM - Shona 😍: Sure
5/19/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Call?
5/19/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna have dinner
5/19/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: Can we talk at the same time?
5/19/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can finish that and call me
5/19/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: 👍🏻
5/20/19, 12:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am sorry that it hurts. But I realized that I feel crushed too. I feel like I am afraid of you. Like I can't express myself freely. Like I have to be a presentable version of myself. If feels like I have to polish myself for you. And honestly, it is a little too demanding. I lie and I cheat and I will always do that. I will always break rules. Because somehow I am like that. My whole life people have asked me to be something I am not. I can't do it in a relationship that I have to have all my life. I love you and I do but the question is that if you do then are you willing to accept these vices of mine?
5/20/19, 12:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And as much as I respect your time, effort, engagements, boundaries, circumstances and everything else. I just can't keep delaying every conversation indefinitely. There has to be a time when we can talk serious stuff. I didn't plan to drop the bomb like this, honestly before picking the phone I didn't even know what to talk about but I guess this is what happens when you keep piling on stuff. And even after that once the topic came up I didn't see why we shouldn't discuss it today.
5/20/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You still had an hour before sleeping so.. and I think that's the most you will have on most days. Also, every conversation has an emotion, once that dies, it's hard to recreate it. If I. Feeling sad and insecure now, I would rather talk about it now as opposed to a Tuesday.
5/20/19, 12:24 AM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry but it really is too much for one day. I. Can't. What mum and dad told today was that Nelli's health has declined rapidly during the last months. She was at the vet this Monday and they suggested euthanasia soon. It will be done on the 28th. I didn't want to tell you yet because I didn't want you to be distracted tomorrow. But I guess that's not something that happens to you since you started this kind of conversation tonight. And I don't mean that in a bad way, I just really didn't know what's the right thing to do. I still don't know if I should say it or not and just suck it up and have this conversation too. But I have cried and mourned so much today already. I don't mean to use it as an excuse to avoid this conversation. But I don't know with what will I do that
5/20/19, 12:28 AM - Shona 😍: That is very worrying that you feel like you need to be a polished vetsion with me. Sounds like you can't be yourself and it shouldn't be like that.
5/20/19, 12:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry to hear that. We can continue this conversation sometime later. Euthanasia will be the best for her. I am attached to her too. I am already having vertigo with the thoughts of her leaving us. I would have loved to meet her but she is old and that sounds like the best for her.
5/20/19, 12:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always imagined this day will come and I was preparing myself mentally that you will need me. Baby this is what happens when you hide things. You should have just typed a message. Can you please call me?
5/20/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am such an asshole. 😞
5/20/19, 12:30 AM - Shona 😍: You are not!!!!
5/20/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The day nelli got lost I could see how worried you got and I always prepared myself for this day. I just am so sorry that I didn't know and ended up acting like this.
5/20/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please talk to me.
5/20/19, 12:31 AM - Shona 😍: Sometimes hiding is good! Mum and dad kept it from us because of my exam and I think it was the right thing to do
5/20/19, 12:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will be fine only if we resolve everything. It will take just half an hour. Video call will be the best.
5/20/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. I am your backbone. I am a rock inside. These things don't affect me somehow. You should have told me right away. My childhood has had profound effects on me, I could have taken it.
5/20/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Anyways, why are we wasting time? Can you please call?
5/20/19, 1:28 AM - Shona 😍: Good night rakas. All the best for tomorrow. Though I guess I will be up in the morning to say that again 😊
5/20/19, 7:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
5/20/19, 7:15 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning ☀
5/20/19, 7:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/20/19, 7:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call?
5/20/19, 7:32 AM - Shona 😍: Yes?
5/20/19, 7:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok ?😄
5/20/19, 7:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/20/19, 7:45 AM - Shona 😍: ❤❤
5/20/19, 7:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙈
5/20/19, 7:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ui
5/20/19, 7:46 AM - Shona 😍: 😚
5/20/19, 7:46 AM - Shona 😍: I love you.
5/20/19, 7:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you
5/20/19, 8:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/20/19, 8:12 AM - Shona 😍: All the best rakas 😍
5/20/19, 8:13 AM - Shona 😍: Say it shona?
5/20/19, 8:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you. I can't say that enough. I miss and I can't say that enough either. You are my life to me you are my wife to me you are the glare of my life, you are the flair of my life. You are  so special to me, you are so so dear to me. I want to be with you all my life. I can't thank you enough for the person you make me and how you enable me to achieve. You are my secret energy source. Just the thought of you makes my morning cheerful, just the dream of you, lulls me further into sleep. I am blessed to have you darling. I well and truly am.
5/20/19, 8:17 AM - Shona 😍: Shona I have no words. I love you. You are incredible.
5/20/19, 8:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Only because you make me.
5/20/19, 8:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And somehow I am not surprised that you don't have words 🙊
5/20/19, 8:37 AM - Shona 😍: The way you are there for me in difficult times is amazing. You soothe me and make me feel like I can go on again. I have never had that before.
5/20/19, 8:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And can I please tell you that you will always have that from me.
5/20/19, 8:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometime, in 2017, I came to this place for the first time. It's called Cyberhub. It is a zone full of corporates. It's both an architectural marvel and a capitalists cave. The first time I was here, I fell in love with it, there was something about it that called me. I immediately wished for me to work in this place. May be the elitist in me was seduced but I  definitely mesmerized by the power that resides in this place. I have heard a lot of bad things about corporate life but I still wanted to try. The money is obviously good but somehow it felt like yes if should have an ambition then it should be of being amongst the top and staying in top in those. I really am amazed that I was able to get this far and that I am finally sitting here. It is both an achievement and a step. A step towards the future, our healthy future. I am really proud of myself that I made it this far and I will always go forward after this. 😇
5/20/19, 2:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is it going baby?
5/20/19, 2:09 PM - Shona 😍: Luckily there's someone else with me otherwise I would be completely lost 😁
5/20/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: So it's goin good
5/20/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: I have a short lunch break now
5/20/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: How is it going for you?
5/20/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: I will reply to this when I have more time
5/20/19, 2:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's going good.
5/20/19, 2:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Boring actually. Lot of information
5/20/19, 4:53 PM - Shona 😍: Well if it's any consolation so was at the hospital. So boring I want to end myself. I have new found respect for people who do that for a living. I don't know how they keep their head together
5/20/19, 4:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure you want to be a Doctor 🤣
5/20/19, 4:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yes however so sadist of me, it is indeed a consolation
5/20/19, 4:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if it makes you smile then here is a clip of me trying to say  myrmaki
5/20/19, 4:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message

5/20/19, 10:03 PM - Shona 😍: That just sucks
5/20/19, 10:03 PM - Shona 😍: Have you used the app before?
5/20/19, 10:04 PM - Shona 😍: For tickets or something else?
5/20/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No.
5/20/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That scares me a bit
5/20/19, 10:09 PM - Shona 😍: How did you find out about it?
5/20/19, 10:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The bank website
5/20/19, 10:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Probably it should fix itself in two days.
5/20/19, 10:13 PM - Shona 😍: Your bank's?
5/20/19, 10:13 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/20/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/20/19, 10:21 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/20/19, 10:21 PM - Shona 😍: Well I think that should be fine then
5/20/19, 10:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/20/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: So going back to this. I thought it went away that you feel like you are afraid of me. I'd like to know what part do you feel like you can't express freely? And is it because you feel like I'm gonna judge you for that part? You said you are gonna lie and cheat and tell your kids that it's okay to do so. Sometimes the lines are blurry between true and false, for example when leaving stuff out and not telling everything. You can't possibly tell everything about anything, something is always left out. But with other things it's very clear, for example telling that you did something, like go toa store when you didn't. Now about cheating. We have grown up in two very different cultures. I think the Finnish culture and society are mostly based on honesty. For example cheating in exams is forbidden and it is penalized if people get caught. And people are also quite careful in making sure these penalties take place. Obviously people try to cheat here too and people lie, but the basic assumption is that the system is supposed to be based on honesty and fairness. And right now I feel like I know too little about such societal structures to actually say such a thing. Maybe it's not fair here either. But I guess what can be said that the society is based on honesty and fairness more than in India. 
I assume it's also forbidden there too to cheat in exams but it has sounded to me that it's not so carefully monitored that people don't do it. But what I've also understood is that they have crazy high standards for you too and you have to give ridiculously difficult exams. So I don't know if it's somehow built in the system that you need to cheat in order to be able to make it. Do you think that it is so or not really?
And about having "bad" thoughts like thoughts of infidelity. I don't think we can control our thoughts. They will come and go and that's just how it is. Acting on them is another thing.
What it does make me wonder though when you say such things about lying and cheating is that how far do you think is okay to go? Where do you put the limit for what is too much of it? Or is speculating about such a limit even useful?
5/20/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/20/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I wonder how I didn't get a notification for the message :O
5/20/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: I'll listen to it now
5/20/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: Can you please just kill me now
5/20/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: So how did you plan on living with a superego-listening-hermit? And how did I plan on living with someone who lies and cheats and thinks it's all fine? I'm not perfect myself but I want to be better morally. I don't think it's a bad or lame goal.
5/20/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: I love you but arrrrrgh
5/20/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: What are we doing
5/20/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: Rakas

5/21/19, 8:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was your day?
5/21/19, 8:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The metro is c r a w l i n g
5/21/19, 8:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not coming on this route again. It's suffocating 😖
5/21/19, 8:17 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. Now that I think of it the best part was talking with you in the morning for 5 minutes. The job is eating my soul. And I've slept so poorly for the past two nights. I'm happy that I finally bought the flights. Also it feels like it's way too hot here :D my brain feels like porridge. Probably the combination of all of the above 😬
5/21/19, 8:18 PM - Shona 😍: 🐌
5/21/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
5/21/19, 8:18 PM - Shona 😍: Don't. So you didn't stay for the class even today?
5/21/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then let's talk for 50 when I get back
5/21/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to work but I can listen to you for a change
5/21/19, 8:19 PM - Shona 😍: The placement preparation?
5/21/19, 8:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Naah
5/21/19, 8:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🐍🐍
5/21/19, 8:20 PM - Shona 😍: What :D
5/21/19, 8:20 PM - Shona 😍: I mean is the work related to the placement preparation or the internship?
5/21/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both
5/21/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a short term and a long term strategy 😃
5/21/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Python 🐍🐍
5/21/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The metro is shit 🤣
5/21/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: 👍🏻
5/21/19, 8:35 PM - Shona 😍: Oh. Now that I got the flight I probably should resign from the office cleaning too. It's a shame, that's like the easiest money one can make :D
5/21/19, 8:35 PM - Shona 😍: I mean I'm gonna continue until the Austria trip
5/21/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: Ah!!!
5/21/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: Poor shona
5/21/19, 8:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. It stopped for 20 mins.
5/21/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We haven't moved since
5/21/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: I wasn't being sarcastic! I meant it
5/21/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: Omg...
5/21/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: That really is crap
5/21/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: YÄK
5/21/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hehe
5/21/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thanks for you pity
5/21/19, 8:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Makes me smile
5/21/19, 8:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that's good.
5/21/19, 8:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😃😃
5/21/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: Hyvä hyvä
5/21/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
5/21/19, 8:44 PM - Shona 😍: The metro cars
5/21/19, 8:44 PM - Shona 😍: Is it crowded?
5/21/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course it is.
5/21/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Darling the immigration was crowded
5/21/19, 8:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is the metro afterall
5/21/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been traveling for almost 3 hours now 😳
5/21/19, 8:45 PM - Shona 😍: Poor poor shona 😩
5/21/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And now somehow my phone is also working slow 😃😃😃
5/21/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Life is awesome! 🤪🤪🤪
5/21/19, 8:45 PM - Shona 😍: 😅😅😅😅
5/21/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm I wish I had something funny to tell you
5/21/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can tell me anything darling. It all makes me smile.
5/21/19, 8:52 PM - Shona 😍: I saw a really big Bern shepherd on the metro today. It was  h u g e. I smiled at it but then I remembered Nelli and... Well. Then I was really sad. The owner of the Bern was in a wheelchair so I thought maybe it was a guide dog. And then I thought it's just lovely how dogs can be trained to help people with disabilities ❤ And they must become such good friends, the owner and the dog
5/21/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel your pain shona
5/21/19, 8:56 PM - Shona 😍: My Nepalese coworker told me something about Nepal, and it's quite interesting that it doesn't get so hot there like in India. Only 35 degrees or so, tops. And then she told they use much less spices than in India, she thought you use way too much. She says if you want to live long you should use less 😄
5/21/19, 9:04 PM - Shona 😍: When was the first time you got drunk?
5/21/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh nice
5/21/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You asking questions on your own
5/21/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is nice.
5/21/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 3rd/4th Feb 2015
5/21/19, 9:07 PM - Shona 😍: Oh!
5/21/19, 9:07 PM - Shona 😍: What was the occasion?
5/21/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: None. Just an impulse.
5/21/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There were some events but those were not the reason
5/21/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was with my dentist
5/21/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In a wedding
5/21/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He is a Punjabi
5/21/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Punjabi's drink a lot
5/21/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He used to too back then
5/21/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: Really? I had no idea
5/21/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How would you have Shona. These are Indian stereotypes
5/21/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: Hehe true
5/21/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, people of Delhi are deemed brash
5/21/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Another important one.
5/21/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/21/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They are perverts
5/21/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well less so than Kanpurites
5/21/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: 😂
5/21/19, 9:10 PM - Shona 😍: So are you the worst perverts in Kanpur?
5/21/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
5/21/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We are the most abusive
5/21/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Unruly
5/21/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Perverted
5/21/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: City in India
5/21/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh oh oh
5/21/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't forget
5/21/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Polluted
5/21/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But probably the most extroverted and outwardly expressive as well. I don't a Kanpurite can be an introvert
5/21/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Finally reached the last stop
5/21/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: Yay!!
5/21/19, 9:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *think a Kanpurite
5/21/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: How much until you reach the apartment?
5/21/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: Got it
5/21/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: And hmm
5/21/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: Didn't I choose well then
5/21/19, 9:15 PM - Shona 😍: What other stereotypes are there? About other parts?
5/21/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 20 mins at least
5/21/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣🤣
5/21/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well let me think of those relevant to you
5/21/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you will come to Delhi
5/21/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So there are two divisions of Delhi
5/21/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: South Delhi and the other obvious one
5/21/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: South Delhi is the more posh part of Delhi
5/21/19, 9:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And people from this parts are really rich brats
5/21/19, 9:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also,
5/21/19, 9:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Never messs with anyone in Delhi
5/21/19, 9:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because everyone has got their connections and everyone thinks they are above the law
5/21/19, 9:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you may never know who may trump whom
5/21/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: People from IITs are total nerds and the stereotypical trajectory of life for them is that they study, they get a high paying job, probably outside the country, get arranged married. And get a very beautiful wife who is generally a housewife and meant to "take care" of the husband.
5/21/19, 9:36 PM - Shona 😍: Very interesting
5/21/19, 9:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Take care being equivalent to
5/21/19, 9:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Having children as many the family demands
5/21/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: And that sounds so foreign to me. To have such "levels"
5/21/19, 9:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being a soccer mom
5/21/19, 9:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Housekeeper
5/21/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Having sec when he pleases
5/21/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Taking care of the mother
5/21/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: Didn't you choose well too then 😂😂😂
5/21/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Basically a sex object but only a butler
5/21/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: Omg...
5/21/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I chose a wife. I was not interested in marrying a trophy
5/21/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: I know. I'm just amused by all of this. The stereotypes
5/21/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: Though maybe I shouldn't be amused. Because all of the women who have to live like that. Maybe some of them are happy. Maybe many. Maybe few. I have no way to know
5/21/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: I mean maybe some find some parts of that fulfilling
5/21/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/21/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/21/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/21/19, 9:56 PM - Shona 😍: Okay huhhuh I didn't know it's mostly that bad. And of course it should be a free choice, if someone wants to be a housewife. And what I meant is that for example being a mother can be fulfilling. But I guess only when it's your own free choice and when you have a partner who truly loves you and respects you
5/21/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: I love it how you think about this. And I love it that you seem so passionate about it
5/21/19, 10:01 PM - Shona 😍: 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
5/21/19, 10:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ♥♥
5/21/19, 10:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Am I getting the videos btw?
5/21/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/21/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: When do you want them
5/21/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now?
5/21/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should I seek an appointment?
5/21/19, 10:08 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂
5/21/19, 10:08 PM - Shona 😍: Just a sec

5/21/19, 10:11 PM - Shona 😍: Shona mum was there, I'm not gonna send them when she sees
5/21/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😳😳
5/21/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry!
5/21/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: :D
5/21/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hope she didn't see that
5/21/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: Coming right up

5/21/19, 10:28 PM - Shona 😍: Have I 😄
5/21/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Call?
5/21/19, 10:31 PM - Shona 😍: Sure
5/22/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
5/22/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you please tell me what porn are you watching these days?
5/22/19, 12:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know when I come these days, I feel that someday, my eyes are going to pop out. I feel such a rush
5/22/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. I love you and I really respect what you do for me but my dear darling. My dearest darling I want you to know that I will love you equally more even if these things were not their between the two of us.
5/22/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My bond with you is that of a friend with whom I like sharing my worries and accomplishments
5/22/19, 12:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will always prefer that over anything else.
5/22/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, another funny thing happened today. I was using earplugs and my manager had no clue. So he kept calling me behind my back sometimes twice or thrice and I didn't listen and then I had to tell him that hey I generally put these on when I work so please just pat me whenever you need me.
5/22/19, 12:07 AM - Shona 😍: 😂😂😂
5/22/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am giving a pair to Neeraj tomorrow. I told him to try these on once. 😄
5/22/19, 12:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thank you for introducing them to me. 😇
5/22/19, 12:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I was thinking rn that I want to be like you and I want to be strict with my schedule. If I had the energy of masturbating twice then I certainly had the energy to code. But I didn't because I gave myself an excuse. Should I be like you? Strict with myself? So strict that I sacrifice our time and should have coded instead? And then u realized that while it's good to be focused and ambitious. Both of us can't be like that. And I am ready to give up work sometimes to talk and spend time with you. It was not that important afterall and we are rarely able to talk freely these days. So that's that. But I guess I realized this that it's good to learn from the other but there is a line to be drawn. A line that distinguishes oneself from the other so that our individuality is maintained and so are our self identities which I think are a must for a healthy relationship. In short, a balance is to be sought.
5/22/19, 12:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then *I
5/22/19, 12:13 AM - Shona 😍: Exactly
5/22/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you. My life is so thoughtful when it has you in it. ♥
5/22/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My life is so focused.
5/22/19, 12:13 AM - Shona 😍: I love you too rakas.
5/22/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is so... poetic.
5/22/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Philosophical
5/22/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby
5/22/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sleep
5/22/19, 12:14 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
5/22/19, 12:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe you can make a request if you want to
5/22/19, 12:14 AM - Shona 😍: I just want to sleep
5/22/19, 12:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then the request is
5/22/19, 12:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me sleep you horny ass
5/22/19, 12:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😃😃😃😃
5/22/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: 🤭😚
5/22/19, 12:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Btw. As a precursor to your trip to India. I WILL NOT LET YOU SLEEP.
5/22/19, 12:16 AM - Shona 😍: Good night. My horny ass love.
5/22/19, 12:16 AM - Shona 😍: Oh god
5/22/19, 12:16 AM - Shona 😍: Well then I can throw my schedule out the window anyway
5/22/19, 12:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤪
5/22/19, 12:17 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm now I'm getting aroused thinking about that
5/22/19, 12:17 AM - Shona 😍: But I will sleep
5/22/19, 12:17 AM - Shona 😍: Good
5/22/19, 12:18 AM - Shona 😍: Night
5/22/19, 12:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
5/22/19, 12:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go

5/22/19, 12:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go
5/22/19, 8:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona it was so hard to empathize with introverts in the beginning. Seriously, I just couldn't wrap my brains around the word when I first came across it. Speaking and expressing myself comes so naturally to me that I never even once by then -and, a good while after that- assumed that it comes naturally to everyone else as well. It was an astounding discovery for me.
5/22/19, 9:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
5/22/19, 9:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mad about you 🎷🎼🎤🎻

5/22/19, 11:18 AM - Shona 😍: 😁
5/22/19, 11:18 AM - Shona 😍: Looking forward to you calming me back
5/22/19, 11:35 AM - Shona 😍: I had a dream last night that I was at the hairdresser and they dyed my hair blonde. Like Daenerys Targaryen blonde. And I was like what the fuck is this, I didn't ask you to dye my hair! But then it actually looked really good. It made me remember the dyes I bought in January that I still have 😁
5/22/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go do it😃
5/22/19, 11:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know it sounds crazy
5/22/19, 11:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you know me
5/22/19, 11:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's what life should be for me
5/22/19, 11:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Crazyyyyy🤪🤪🤪🤪
5/22/19, 11:42 AM - Shona 😍: I love you 😄

5/22/19, 7:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/22/19, 7:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not as it could have been
5/22/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 7:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 👙 everytime all the time 🤐😍😍😍😍😍
5/22/19, 8:00 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm so is that what you want others to see too
5/22/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you think you will be able to walk after what I will do to you?
5/22/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: Oh got
5/22/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I'm sorry if that's rude.
5/22/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: I got wet the second I read that
5/22/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😃
5/22/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/6EA-MIYY1bg
5/22/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Binging on the song
5/22/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Play it to Laura
5/22/19, 8:11 PM - Shona 😍: But that was also a serious question and you gonna have to tell me before I come. I don't know if I have appropriate clothing for the public
5/22/19, 8:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can wear shorts and any dresses you want. Delhi is very open about such things just nothing too showy. Also, if you were to go to Kanpur then that's a different thing.
5/22/19, 8:17 PM - Shona 😍: Oh! Well good to know. The shorts that I have are quite short though. I'll just check them with you when I'm about to pack then
5/22/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. Short shorts will have their uses so  I will probably have to ask you to bring them along 😃
5/22/19, 8:23 PM - Shona 😍: 😄
5/22/19, 10:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I am guessing you are having great time with laura
5/22/19, 10:15 PM - Shona 😍: She and mum are watching a series
5/22/19, 10:16 PM - Shona 😍: I'm preparing stuff for tomorrow
5/22/19, 10:16 PM - Shona 😍: Pretty much done though
5/22/19, 10:17 PM - Shona 😍: I also tried to make some kind of a goal how many shifts I want to do in the summer = how much I want/need to make
5/22/19, 10:17 PM - Shona 😍: How are you?
5/22/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/22/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tired but going strong
5/22/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Having a great time in life
5/22/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Figuring out what I want from life
5/22/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Enjoying my stay here
5/22/19, 10:18 PM - Shona 😍: What are you up to
5/22/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Learning
5/22/19, 10:18 PM - Shona 😍: Oooh
5/22/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Gaining confidence
5/22/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Experiences that I never imagined
5/22/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, having a free life away from mom really suits me. I like the freedom
5/22/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: Oh? Something similar you had here?
5/22/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry I may not have answered your question
5/22/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
5/22/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is how I feel
5/22/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes ma'am
5/22/19, 10:21 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds like you're really doing great 😊
5/22/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All because of you
5/22/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You taught me this
5/22/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To learn from life
5/22/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To have grit
5/22/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I will read the book someday
5/22/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But for now you are it's summary to me
5/22/19, 10:26 PM - Shona 😍: I couldn't be more happy about that. It gives me hope and warms my heart now that I'm not very inspired by the things I do these days. Or maybe it's because I haven't really established a proper routine yet with the new things.
5/22/19, 10:27 PM - Shona 😍: It kinda feels like I'm just waiting until it's the end of June and I will know what happens in the Autumn. And that's really not the best mentality
5/22/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: Are you busy?
5/22/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No.
5/22/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just had my target set from today that I will complete two lessons in Python
5/22/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So completing that
5/22/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I learnt it from you
5/22/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Work first.
5/22/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Feels bad doesn't it?
5/22/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *wrong
5/22/19, 10:55 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not exactly following
5/22/19, 10:56 PM - Shona 😍: You're working on the Python now?
5/22/19, 10:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes babu
5/22/19, 10:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And
5/22/19, 10:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am missing you
5/22/19, 10:57 PM - Shona 😍: Alright
5/22/19, 10:57 PM - Shona 😍: I miss you too
5/22/19, 10:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 10:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 10:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 10:57 PM - Shona 😍: :D
5/22/19, 10:57 PM - Shona 😍: Cool.
5/22/19, 10:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
5/22/19, 10:57 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna sleep in 45mins or so
5/22/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah sure
5/22/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry now I am not following
5/22/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you with me
5/22/19, 11:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am trying to say that I learnt it from you to put work first and complete your targets no matter what but Shona. I used to feel neglected and bad too. And I am wondering if you also feel that it's somehow not right and I should give everything up rn and talk to you.
5/22/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And don't quote me but I meant if you have a similar feeling
5/22/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: I have no idea if you should give up on what you're doing rn. It does feel bad, but overall I think it's about finding a good balance. Sometimes it's okay to choose work imo. I have done it myself as you said. I think finding the balance comes over time with trying different things. Maybe there's no time to talk for long every day. I was just thinking about it a while ago when I was taking a shower. Like how Laura and Farzad talked for hours for days and didn't even sleep and they were late for work etc because of those talks. But maybe I shouldn't compare since they're in a very different stage in their relationship than us. My point is, I don't know what's a good balance. I don't know what's the best approach for the long term.
5/22/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: Anyhow tonight I don't think there's time to talk. You're still working and I'd like to sleep soon. We did talk earlier in the day and that was lovely.
5/22/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That reminds me
5/22/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to tell you
5/22/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Amidst all the work
5/22/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You were my relief. You were my emancipation
5/22/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: I love you. I hate living in a different country away from you.
5/22/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't hate it. Enjoy it. I have started enjoying it. I love to have you at a distance. It sure as hell limits sex and furthers dialogue. And I couldn't be happier to share my thoughts and feelings with you.
5/22/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The stereotypes
5/22/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My feelings
5/22/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My habits
5/22/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My achievements
5/22/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My reactions from moment to moment
5/22/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My micro triumphs
5/22/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My low moods
5/22/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just feel you know me so much better because of the distance
5/22/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also I learnt this attitude from you again. Enjoy life as it is.
5/22/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: Okay. Maybe I'm feeling this because I hate my job atm. It was all fine when I was studying for the exam 😄
5/22/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: I will have to work on my attitude or then just not work at the hospital.
5/22/19, 11:15 PM - Shona 😍: Let's see. Tomorrow is a new day.
5/22/19, 11:16 PM - Shona 😍: That is certainly a good thing
5/22/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah and maybe I am loving it because I have a good job
5/22/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. Attitude change is something you should look for.
5/22/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I might have something to say on that
5/22/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am guessing you did not read the paper?
5/22/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby.
5/22/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a challenge for you
5/22/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That may make your work less boring
5/22/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you write a story? A good story? Mentally while you clean? With a character and a plotline? And a climax and an ending. With adjectives and descriptions. It's ok if you can't find words but just the basics of it?
5/22/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think we all can tell great stories
5/22/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Especially you
5/22/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Who is so observany
5/22/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: Only the beginning. I could not focus my mind was racing. All the things related to what I need to take care of before the trip and then the job what to do with it
5/22/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *observant
5/22/19, 11:24 PM - Shona 😍: I dunno
5/22/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well then take care of it first.
5/22/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is a thing such as attention restoration theory
5/22/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I think it is really something
5/22/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Every incomplete task takes up some part of your attention
5/22/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's not good.
5/22/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I can imagine
5/22/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I delayed the project for 4 months
5/22/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So..
5/22/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just complete the other thing asap and then you can do something mentally creative on the job.
5/22/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: Let's see.
5/22/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: Good night dear.
5/22/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby
5/23/19, 6:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning

5/23/19, 1:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My caste
5/23/19, 1:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a tangy tasting powder that helps in constipation
5/23/19, 1:47 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmh
5/23/19, 1:47 PM - Shona 😍: What does being a Marwari have to do with it?
5/23/19, 1:48 PM - Shona 😍: And is it the same as Vaishya
5/23/19, 1:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Marwaris are a kind of Vaishya
5/23/19, 1:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will explain someday when there is you me and a whiteboard

5/23/19, 2:36 PM - Shona 😍: They actually help me in the kitchen
5/23/19, 2:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😃
5/23/19, 2:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Great!!
5/23/19, 2:37 PM - Shona 😍: How's it going for you?
5/23/19, 2:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I finally got assigned to the team
5/23/19, 2:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Superficially the work seems interesting
5/23/19, 2:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I have to go through a text heavy ppt of 36 slides. Full of acronyms 🙊
5/23/19, 2:39 PM - Shona 😍: Oh my
5/23/19, 2:39 PM - Shona 😍: Have you had any coffee today?
5/23/19, 2:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A cup
5/23/19, 2:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thanks for reminding 😒
5/23/19, 2:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now I feel like having one.
5/23/19, 2:43 PM - Shona 😍: Oh 😅😅😅
5/23/19, 2:43 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm but it's only 3pm there?
5/23/19, 2:43 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think that's too late
5/23/19, 2:44 PM - Shona 😍: And two cups a day is not too bad imo
5/23/19, 2:44 PM - Shona 😍: But if you can substitute it with tea maybe it's better for the sleep
5/23/19, 2:45 PM - Shona 😍: Assuming they're not huge cups
5/23/19, 2:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
5/23/19, 3:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baccha
5/23/19, 3:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mich u
5/23/19, 4:42 PM - Shona 😍: I mich u two
5/23/19, 4:42 PM - Shona 😍: I'm done!
5/23/19, 4:42 PM - Shona 😍: Such a nice shift
5/23/19, 5:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I had a sleepy day
5/23/19, 5:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not that exciting
5/23/19, 5:33 PM - Shona 😍: Well you haven't been sleeping well this week
5/23/19, 5:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/v2YXKwr2FzE
5/23/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby?
5/23/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You seem very very busy today 🙁
5/23/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: Shonaaaaaaa
5/23/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: I napped for an hour
5/23/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: Talked with mum
5/23/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: I have a dance class with Laura in two hours
5/23/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: What are you up to?
5/23/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄😄😄
5/23/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you guess?
5/23/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sure it was good.
5/23/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do that with Jari too sometime
5/23/19, 7:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sure you can find something to talk about
5/23/19, 7:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just grab him and sit in his lap
5/23/19, 7:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like you would when you were little
5/23/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: 🐍? 🥏? 🍉?
5/23/19, 7:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The first
5/23/19, 7:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
5/23/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah I asked if she wants to join the Reggaeton classes
5/23/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: 😬😬
5/23/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: Huhhuh
5/23/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: Are you at the apartment though?
5/23/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/23/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: Do you have much of it left?
5/23/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: Overall
5/23/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's crazy how I am super tired but am still able tow work
5/23/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah
5/23/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just half an hour's work
5/23/19, 7:53 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. That's good. But please try to sleep more tonight baby
5/23/19, 7:53 PM - Shona 😍: Oh!
5/23/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't like it when you ignore what you don't want to talk about.
5/23/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi. Yes.
5/23/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Anyway
5/23/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I asked Laura to do it
5/23/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/23/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry. I didn't like it that you said that. Or maybe I do but I also feel like slapping /biting/ blowing in your face or doing something like that.
5/23/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭🤭🤭
5/23/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have changed
5/23/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have changed you.
5/23/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I like the change
5/23/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is going to be so much slapping and running around when you come here.
5/23/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: 🏃🏻🏃🏼‍♀🦶🏼✋🏻
5/23/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: Daring me like that moves nothing in me. I don't care
5/23/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: And by that I mean the type of motivation, not the matter at hand itself
5/23/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Again, I don't know where you got that from but that was not the intent
5/23/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just wanted Jari to have what I make my mother feel
5/23/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And since you are not going to do it
5/23/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I asked Laura
5/23/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I sent you the screenshot because I feel my language may have offended you if you would have been told by her.
5/23/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I told you instead
5/23/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you feel I am darling you then I don't know how to dissuade you
5/23/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: These are exactly the kind of things I am afraid of. Because I feel like I pissed you off and that is what I always fear that I live in this constant doubt and fear that I may piss of the love of my life something that I don't want to do. Even with such a kind intent of just spreading love and affection for Jari. All that I end up doing is pissing you off and it freaks the hell out of me
5/23/19, 8:09 PM - Shona 😍: Shona I'm not pissed off! And even if I were, so what? I will piss you off sometimes and you will piss me off sometimes too. It's life. I was about to say that I actually love it how you think and say such things and in a way try to help us be closer. I. Love. It. I absolutely love that about you. Have I not said it before? Shame on me. Why I refuse to do it because such closeness doesn't really feel natural after these years of not being so close.
5/23/19, 8:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I'm anxious rn
5/23/19, 8:11 PM - Shona 😍: Baby why???
5/23/19, 8:13 PM - Shona 😍: And now I feel like a cold hearted witch
5/23/19, 8:13 PM - Shona 😍: Shona
5/23/19, 8:14 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't mean to make you feel bad
5/23/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You didn't
5/23/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just getting more anxious by the day these days
5/23/19, 8:26 PM - Shona 😍: In general or later in the day?
5/23/19, 8:26 PM - Shona 😍: You are working long days
5/23/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah maybe I am stressing myself out for no reason
5/23/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't worry. You will get there. I will keep pushing you until you are a little pissed off so that we incrementally increase your level of engagements with your family 😌.
And hey, however so unnatural to you, you are still a human and you just have to take a step forward. Jari is like Tauji at least in his levels of expectancy from others. He just gives and doesn't has in his capacity to shout out and ask what he wants or maybe that is what the impression I have of him. He has poor feedback and that is not good. If I was there living with you guys. I would go over the line to make it a point that he gets loved equally, of course keeping in mind his comfort levels
5/23/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are not
5/23/19, 8:34 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmm
5/23/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah I think that pushing will work when done slowly. Maybe he is partially like that how you described. Partially I think it's the introvertedness. And maybe I'm not sure about his comfort levels either
5/23/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: I wish I was there to give you a massage
5/23/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Talk to Laura about it.
5/23/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙈
5/23/19, 9:04 PM - Shona 😍: Shy?
5/23/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yech
5/23/19, 9:07 PM - Shona 😍: I would have you lay down on your stomach on the bed or a sofa in your shorts, then sit on you and use some nice oil and massage your shoulders, neck and back
5/23/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What would you use to massage me
5/23/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Your hands?
5/23/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: What would you want me to massage you with
5/23/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can tell you many ways.
5/23/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you think of some?
5/23/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: I can
5/23/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: I can think of funny body parts to massage you with and sexy body parts
5/23/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙈
5/23/19, 11:15 PM - Shona 😍: Wow the dance class was hot. In every meaning of the word
5/23/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
5/23/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do it for me sometime
5/23/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Laura thinks that too?
5/23/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Any guys there?
5/23/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I had a two hour long political debate with my flatmate seniors
5/23/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Feeling very aroused
5/23/19, 11:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby
5/23/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: Good night shonu!
5/23/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: We're just about to reach home
5/23/19, 11:38 PM - Shona 😍: From the debate? 😁
5/23/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking if we could text for a while before I sleep
5/23/19, 11:38 PM - Shona 😍: No
5/23/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. Btw aroused has different meanings and contexts.
5/23/19, 11:38 PM - Shona 😍: I know
5/23/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A pity. You sure has hell would have thought of naughty stuff
5/23/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just checking
5/23/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: But when you say that in the evening the first thing I think of it as sexual arousal
5/23/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
5/23/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: Actually pretty much always when you say it 😬
5/23/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On that note. You still have life lines to go
5/23/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: Wha?
5/23/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Two life lines
5/23/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or should I say two points?
5/23/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: I'm starving, I'm gonna eat and pack lunch and take a shower
5/23/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: That's gonna take a while
5/23/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can go then.
5/23/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am going to try sleeping
5/23/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: I thought of using one yesterday but you were busy
5/23/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😞
5/23/19, 11:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry
5/23/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: It's fine
5/23/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not able to devote enough time these days
5/23/19, 11:44 PM - Shona 😍: I think that's a good idea
5/23/19, 11:44 PM - Shona 😍: Shona it's a phase so it's fine. We will find the balance
5/23/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
5/23/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
5/23/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: Good night
5/23/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: Puccha rakas
5/23/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am touching myself rn
5/23/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: I'm eating rn
5/23/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: Earlier
5/23/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😃
5/23/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: After work
5/23/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What a mix
5/23/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: I was touching myself
5/23/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: I was imagining I was eating you
5/23/19, 11:50 PM - Shona 😍: And drinking you
5/23/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: I was thinking about you
5/23/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭
5/23/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. I know I have a nice ass
5/23/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙈
5/23/19, 11:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby
5/24/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: Haha you do but that's not what I was thinking about
5/24/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
5/24/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: I was thinking you couldn't have handled the class 😁 a hall full of girls, many of them basically in underwear
5/24/19, 12:05 AM - Shona 😍: I mean shorts as short as underpants and sports bra/ tops
5/24/19, 12:06 AM - Shona 😍: But all the ass shaking was fun 😄
5/24/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: Was it about your elections? There was an article about it in our newspaper too. I didn't read it yet though
5/24/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: Also I had a weird thought. The hair dyes that I have are close to the color pf Nelli's fur. So dying my hair with them would also remind me of Nelli. That seems kind of creepy
5/24/19, 1:03 AM - Shona 😍: And when I was brushing my teeth I remembered the times when we brushed each other teeth. That was the sweetest thing
5/24/19, 1:08 AM - Shona 😍: Good night aarteeni
5/24/19, 6:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
5/24/19, 6:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Morning
5/24/19, 7:30 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
5/24/19, 8:16 AM - Shona 😍: How did you sleep?
5/24/19, 8:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 6 hours again
5/24/19, 8:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The morning anxiety was a bit less
5/24/19, 8:22 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/24/19, 8:22 AM - Shona 😍: Well that's a good thing
5/24/19, 8:23 AM - Shona 😍: Are you at the office?
5/24/19, 8:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes ma'am
5/24/19, 8:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For about an hour now
5/24/19, 8:23 AM - Shona 😍: Ok
5/24/19, 8:24 AM - Shona 😍: Early bird
5/24/19, 8:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Catches the 🐛
5/24/19, 8:25 AM - Shona 😍: Did you finish 🐍 yesterday?
5/24/19, 8:25 AM - Shona 😍: Yes 😁
5/24/19, 8:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Almost
5/24/19, 8:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was not productive at all in the end so had to stop
5/24/19, 8:25 AM - Shona 😍: I can imagine
5/24/19, 8:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was not able to write a simple code.
5/24/19, 8:27 AM - Shona 😍: What's on your agenda today at work ? More coding?
5/24/19, 8:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No!
5/24/19, 8:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Call?
5/24/19, 8:27 AM - Shona 😍: Ok
5/24/19, 8:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: HyperNormalisation https://g.co/kgs/7upGHC
5/24/19, 8:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to watch this with me?
5/24/19, 8:57 AM - Shona 😍: Seems interesting
5/24/19, 9:05 AM - Shona 😍: I'm a bit shocked right now. I was looking for some reggaeton videos for you and I found one with guys dancing... It was quite hmm something and I was smiling widely. A Finnish guy maybe my age walked up to me and said, hey, don't smile like that in public 😄 I was like huh? And he said he was kidding, he said I looked really beautiful when I smiled. Never have I had a Finn do such a thing before.
5/24/19, 9:05 AM - Shona 😍: Anywho
5/24/19, 9:05 AM - Shona 😍: Here's the video 😬
5/24/19, 9:06 AM - Shona 😍: https://youtu.be/SrvETkLYTsM
5/24/19, 9:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Huhu
5/24/19, 9:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go out on a date with him e😝😝
5/24/19, 9:07 AM - Shona 😍: Shut up
5/24/19, 9:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it's a little more than twerking?
5/24/19, 9:08 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm perhaps
5/24/19, 9:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/KJDKL6K-kOs
5/24/19, 9:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is this it?
5/24/19, 9:08 AM - Shona 😍: 😂
5/24/19, 9:09 AM - Shona 😍: That again
5/24/19, 9:09 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
5/24/19, 9:09 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe
5/24/19, 9:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well well well
5/24/19, 9:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The universe conspires
5/24/19, 9:09 AM - Shona 😍: Quite similar yeah
5/24/19, 9:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You hate the video don't you?
5/24/19, 9:13 AM - Shona 😍: I haven't watched it entirely
5/24/19, 9:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That doesn't answer my question
5/24/19, 9:14 AM - Shona 😍: Hate is too strong word, I don't have such strong opinion on it
5/24/19, 9:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then what is it?
5/24/19, 9:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you speak on your own or will only say if I ask and lead you there. I think it's obvious what I am trying here. To get to know your opinion on it. Whether or not you like it. If not then why not. Because I like it a lot. If you smiled at the guy video then I can guess some reasons but I can't comprehend why then won't you like the girl video. It's essentially the same thing. Is it because of sex appeal. That guys are sexy to you and girls are sexy to me if yes then good. Because I didn't like the guy video at all.  What I think they were doing was funny. Anyhow, you liking it makes it a certainty that this dance form stimulates you sexually and I can feel less guilty that I get aroused whenever I see that video because then I am not the only one. Because maybe this dance is like that.
5/24/19, 9:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And by stimulates you sexually I mean simulates any third person.
5/24/19, 9:28 AM - Shona 😍: Shona my shift starts
5/24/19, 9:28 AM - Shona 😍: I'll think about it more and let you know what I think about it
5/24/19, 9:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/24/19, 9:29 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe there's something I refuse to admit to myself when I think I don't have an opinion on it
5/24/19, 9:30 AM - Shona 😍: So I will watch it again and think
5/24/19, 9:30 AM - Shona 😍: But now I gotta work
5/24/19, 9:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://www.quora.com/How-are-the-people-in-Kanpur
5/24/19, 11:28 AM - Shona 😍: ❤
5/24/19, 12:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/24/19, 3:34 PM - Shona 😍: Oh God
5/24/19, 4:26 PM - Shona 😍: Ok so I finally watched the entire video. So it is literally all about their asses. I didn't like it. Sure, they're nicely shaped asses but I was struggling to watch it 'til the end. It was mostly just funny and I was laughing almost throughout the video. But that's about it. I don't hate it but I don't think I can watch it again. Hmm okay maybe I hate it then :D But I did find the guy video hot. Slightly funny but still sexually stimulating. I think it's those type of movements that make it so.
5/24/19, 4:41 PM - Shona 😍: Also those videos describe quite well what we did  in the Reggaeton class :P slightly less twerking than in the Go Gyal video
5/24/19, 5:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slept for two hours.
5/24/19, 5:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😳
5/24/19, 5:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My God. 🤯🤯
5/24/19, 5:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I needed that sleep so badly
5/24/19, 5:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just don't want to open my eyes.
5/24/19, 5:34 PM - Shona 😍: ❤❤
5/24/19, 5:34 PM - Shona 😍: You at the apartment?
5/24/19, 5:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/24/19, 5:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I came back early
5/24/19, 5:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was burned out
5/24/19, 5:35 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
5/24/19, 5:35 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds smart
5/24/19, 5:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad I did
5/24/19, 5:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The nap tho
5/24/19, 5:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: People in my house are bums
5/24/19, 5:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean here in the apartment
5/24/19, 5:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Amit is waking me up in the middle of the sleep.
5/24/19, 5:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Asking
5/24/19, 5:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I am fine.
5/24/19, 5:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I came back early
5/24/19, 5:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then they started talking at God knows what volume
5/24/19, 5:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I could hear them through my earplugs
5/24/19, 5:37 PM - Shona 😍: Poor kulta
5/24/19, 5:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can't see a sleeping man of the size of a bull
5/24/19, 5:37 PM - Shona 😍: But he was worried?
5/24/19, 5:38 PM - Shona 😍: :D
5/24/19, 5:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What is more important. Rest for a sleeping man or an insignificant question that will do nothing at that moment
5/24/19, 5:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If a man is ill they need rest 🙁
5/24/19, 5:39 PM - Shona 😍: Well if you'd been really sick maybe you would've needed some care. But as you were fine otherwise besides sleep deprivation I can understand it's annoying
5/24/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Darling
5/24/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can't say much about Finland
5/24/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But imo
5/24/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Guys don't take care
5/24/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They just ask.
5/24/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They don't take care like they should or I do
5/24/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Even if I would have been seriously ill. He would  have said. You are very ill. Take rest 🤣
5/24/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm shame on them then. But the guys I know, I think they would take care of someone ill
5/24/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: Okay maybe only some of them 😬
5/24/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: How useful
5/24/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe it was to check if you're alive :P
5/24/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As a joke. Yes.
5/24/19, 5:48 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know him but I almost feel like slapping him for disturbing your sleep 🤭
5/24/19, 5:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let him come back. Let him speak.
5/24/19, 5:49 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
5/24/19, 5:49 PM - Shona 😍: I'm also kidding
5/24/19, 5:49 PM - Shona 😍: How was work?
5/24/19, 5:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Interesting
5/24/19, 5:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very very interesting
5/24/19, 5:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Learnt so much
5/24/19, 5:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Going to learn more everyday
5/24/19, 5:53 PM - Shona 😍: That's the best
5/24/19, 5:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very encouraging words Shona. Thanks.
5/24/19, 5:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
5/24/19, 6:38 PM - Shona 😍: Wow the bus driver was a dick. People sometimes exit through the front door when there are no people coming in. Some drivers don't let people exit from the front door and I've never really thought about why, I've just thought they're... I don't know what. Not nice. Well today I saw him letting people exit from the front door and I tried to do it myself. He first didn't open the door and I looked at him wondering why he didn't open the door. Then he opened it and said to me let me first tell you something. Then he started raging about how people don't realize how it's because of the air conditioning that they prefer opening as few doors as possible. It would've been fine with me had he said it friendly or just neutrally but he was clearly pissed and it felt like he was taking his frustration about it on me. He hadn't lectured the people exiting before me on the previous stops. And in the end he said I shouldn't be wearing headphones when walking in public and at that point I felt like saying fuck you asshole, that's none of your business and I left the bus and thanked him for the ride in an angry tone. On the other hand I feel like reporting that to the bus company but on the other hand I think he probably just had a bad day and him being disrespectful to me is not enough of a reason for him to get a warning or something that could affect his job. Huhhuh.
5/24/19, 6:38 PM - Shona 😍: Well _isn't_ that the best? 😬
5/24/19, 6:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No it's not. Do you want me to lecture you about it?
5/24/19, 6:43 PM - Shona 😍: Well please
5/24/19, 6:43 PM - Shona 😍: But later
5/24/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna take a nap 😬
5/24/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go sleep
5/24/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you
5/24/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mmmuah
5/24/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😕
5/24/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: ☺
5/24/19, 6:45 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too
5/24/19, 6:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will python
5/24/19, 6:46 PM - Shona 😍: Go Python
5/24/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190521-10-dream-homes-from-the-past-century?ocid=fbqtz
5/24/19, 7:56 PM - Shona 😍: Do you like those?
5/24/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The last one.
5/24/19, 8:14 PM - Shona 😍: Oh!
5/24/19, 8:17 PM - Shona 😍: When are you going to Kanpur?
5/24/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't speak to Tauji
5/24/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So maybe I am not
5/24/19, 8:34 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
5/24/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
5/24/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sup?
5/24/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: I started watching got 🙈
5/24/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
5/24/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: It will be a lot of work I'm starting from season 1😂
5/24/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Save yourself
5/24/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not worth it
5/24/19, 9:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There are much better things to be done
5/24/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: It's already too late
5/24/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: I like it
5/24/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well
5/24/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
5/24/19, 9:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is this supposed to be funny or romantic?
5/24/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: It's supposed to be creepy
5/24/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not to me. Sorry
5/24/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: Well what do you think about it then?
5/24/19, 9:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Either
5/24/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: But doing it to a stranger!
5/24/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: That's creepy
5/24/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I imagined you
5/24/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
5/24/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: Well the point was doing it to someone you don't know
5/24/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't care what the point was
5/24/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: Doing it to me, yes that'd be funny/romantic
5/24/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not in a good mood.
5/24/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: Do you want to talk about it?
5/24/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
5/24/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: No?
5/24/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
5/24/19, 9:50 PM - Shona 😍: Ok. If you change your mind I'm here.
5/24/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I changed my mind.
5/24/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: Please say
5/24/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will judge me
5/24/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am going to say it
5/24/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am into a 40 year old from my workplace
5/24/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I find her really sexy
5/24/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd I think it's purely sexual
5/24/19, 9:54 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/24/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Obviously I am infatuated
5/24/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that points out to a very very specific thing about my personality
5/24/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I get infatuated very easily
5/24/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that I can infatuated by very different kind of people
5/24/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I felt guilty about it the whole day
5/24/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And she is a mom
5/24/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She brought her kid today
5/24/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But even that didn't kill the mood
5/24/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that made me feel even more guilty
5/24/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is why I left early
5/24/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I had terrible dreams
5/24/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I couldn't talk to you freely
5/24/19, 9:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I try speaking to someone else about it so that I don't have to discuss with you.
5/24/19, 9:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I know these kind of things disturb you.
5/24/19, 9:58 PM - Shona 😍: It actually crossed my mind at some point before you started there. That will there be someone you crush over or something, as I thought there will be some boss ladies around. I mean I thought that when I remembered your fantasy/ definition of sexy.
5/24/19, 9:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I ended up fighting with that person and blocking em for ever
5/24/19, 9:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exactly!
5/24/19, 9:59 PM - Shona 😍: The one you talked with about it?
5/24/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/24/19, 9:59 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
5/24/19, 10:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Say something?
5/24/19, 10:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it's the power affiliation
5/24/19, 10:21 PM - Shona 😍: I'm digesting it
5/24/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby.
5/24/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: Good night
5/24/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: What I'm feeling about this: slightly disappointed, slightly doubtful. Calm. Things will work out, in some way or another. Life is bullshit but that's okay. Sometimes it's better. The purpose of it is still love.
5/24/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't expect such a reaction
5/24/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I expected something far worse
5/24/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Btw.
5/24/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Today was brothers day
5/25/19, 12:01 AM - Shona 😍: Also I'm not saying this to blame you, but I'm curious. What good did you think will come of telling me that?
5/25/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will take it as a point that you can't see clearly because you maybe agitated but there are many obvious benefits to it
5/25/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: First, I am feeling guilty of thinking about such a thing. So talking helos
5/25/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *helps
5/25/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then, I don't expect you to be supportive, actually I do, but you being supportive or not is upto you. But in the case you had been empathizing and supportive that it's ok for me to feel such things. I would have maybe gotten over the fear, thence the guilt, thence the emotion entirely, maybe.
5/25/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, telling you about this also comes under our life long project of getting to know each other.
5/25/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, you were thinking about it, I was thinking about it, so why is there a problem or a question of pointlessness if we discuss if? Isn't the whole point of talking and communication is sharing thoughts/beliefs and ideas and do you not feel closer to the person when those ideas/beliefs/thoughts match? And had that happened and I would have felt closer, who knows maybe I would have felt safer and more secured and would have perhaps been able to push the thought out of my mind.
5/25/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
5/25/19, 12:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't type anymore
5/25/19, 12:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My eyes wont open anymore
5/25/19, 12:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I took melatonin
5/25/19, 9:46 AM - Shona 😍: So you took it in a wrong way anyway.
5/25/19, 9:49 AM - Shona 😍: I asked because I didn't know myself if I think it was a good or a bad thing that you told it. So I asked that neutrally, I wasn't agitated yesterday.
5/25/19, 9:55 AM - Shona 😍: I was and am seriously trying to understand what's the most constructive way to go about it
5/25/19, 10:11 AM - Shona 😍: The reason why I think it might not have been a good idea to tell me is because it is very easy to start feeling hurt and unwanted by you in this kind of a situation. It takes extra effort to rationalize with myself. That's why I had to digest it for a good while yesterday.
5/25/19, 10:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
5/25/19, 10:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slept very well. 😃
5/25/19, 10:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes I did
5/25/19, 10:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really appreciate you taking it a neutral way. I am sorry that I presumed something otherwise
5/25/19, 10:43 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
5/25/19, 11:20 AM - Shona 😍: What are your plans for the weekend?
5/25/19, 11:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Talking to you.
5/25/19, 11:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A lot of talking to you.
5/25/19, 11:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Missing you
5/25/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A lot of missing byou
5/25/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *you
5/25/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Doing things for you
5/25/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A lot of doing things for you v
5/25/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And most importantly
5/25/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Loving you
5/25/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A lot of loving you
5/25/19, 11:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Busy much?
5/25/19, 11:58 AM - Shona 😍: I started listening to this
5/25/19, 12:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you think we need it?
5/25/19, 12:07 PM - Shona 😍: I find it insightful already
5/25/19, 12:07 PM - Shona 😍: So I think at least I will benefit from reading it
5/25/19, 12:08 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe you already know from experience some of the things and you do it unconsciously
5/25/19, 12:09 PM - Shona 😍: But perhaps you'd find it interesting too because it's based on actual marital research
5/25/19, 12:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure. I will give it a read.
5/25/19, 12:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You seem pissed?
5/25/19, 12:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or somehow disinterested?
5/25/19, 12:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In talking?
5/25/19, 12:31 PM - Shona 😍: It feels like I don't have much to say
5/25/19, 12:50 PM - Shona 😍: Or maybe it just feels like I have to think so carefully what to say and what not to say I don't know what to do
5/25/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to think carefully
5/25/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are empathizing
5/25/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's all that matters
5/25/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Other than that.
5/25/19, 1:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand if it's too much
5/25/19, 1:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not saying you have to agree or particularly like it
5/25/19, 2:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/25/19, 2:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/25/19, 2:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just in case if you need it for the Visa application

5/25/19, 3:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it's that bad?
5/25/19, 3:28 PM - Shona 😍: Babe what do you want me to say?
5/25/19, 3:28 PM - Shona 😍: No, I don't like it
5/25/19, 3:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want you to talk to me.
5/25/19, 3:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good or bad
5/25/19, 3:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want you to either but does that means stop talking?
5/25/19, 3:47 PM - Shona 😍: Let's speak on call?
5/25/19, 3:47 PM - Shona 😍: But let me finish lunch first
5/25/19, 3:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a good news for you
5/25/19, 3:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean it's a good news in general
5/25/19, 3:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can't say if it's for you
5/25/19, 4:13 PM - Shona 😍: ?
5/25/19, 4:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes Shona. Please.
5/25/19, 4:46 PM - Shona 😍: Wow I feel much worse after the call
5/25/19, 4:46 PM - Shona 😍: Also
5/25/19, 4:47 PM - Shona 😍: I started to look for an airbnb
5/25/19, 5:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can
5/25/19, 5:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry. But the house is full of too many people
5/25/19, 5:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I have no control over them
5/25/19, 5:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish I could be there in person and apologize.
5/25/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is really no way I can do much about it from here.
5/25/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I've tried but I can't help but feel quite hurt right now
5/25/19, 8:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will have to say more.
5/25/19, 8:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course you are and I understand
5/25/19, 8:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you will still have to talk to me Shona.
5/25/19, 8:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry that you feel that way
5/25/19, 8:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But we will have to eventually talk
5/25/19, 8:24 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
5/25/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry I was offline for two hours
5/25/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I finally got my phone repaired
5/25/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It looks like new 🤯
5/25/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: Cool

5/25/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: I started reading the former
5/25/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😍😍😍
5/25/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: Real interesting
5/25/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/25/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I say something
5/25/19, 8:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I remember in February there was a day when I was tearing off my hair. Because my head was exploding with all the future thoughts about us. I was missing you and I was having withdrawals from my stronger meds. I felt like killing myself. I felt like slitting my throat my thighs and my arms. I felt like stabbing my stomach. Those were not good thoughts. As I said. I was already pulling my hair. Swaying like a mental patient. Crying burying my face in my pillow. Soaking it with my tears. Supressing my tears. My voice, I didn't want people in next room to hear me. I didn't want to call Mom. I couldn't, she would have been disturbed. I kept lieing down and getting up but there was no running away. In the end I slapped myself several times, cried a little more and then popped anti anxiety pills and just lay there waiting for it to pass
5/25/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now why I am telling you all this. I remember that day that I desperately needed you. I actually needed you and many times after that but how many times do you remember me asking you to give up studying in the middle of the day and talking to me. I am not saying you never did that. But there were many many times when I felt I desperately needed to talk to you but still I didn't, because I understood that you had and exam to prepare for and you didn't have time.  But that's not the end, even when you had dance classes, I didn't utter a word. I understood that your hobbies were important to you. But over me? That's what I never understood. 

And take it from me, if I had even a very important meeting and you will cry I will leave that meeting at once. Not even a chance. 
But I never complained. You know why? Because, I love you and I understand that life is not all good and Rosy and that the other person is only human and they may not understand. That priorities change in a relationship or that I need you. It takes time to keep someone else above yourself. But I never said a word Shona.
5/25/19, 8:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Again, my point, I am not saying you can't feel hurt because I did something in a past or that you owe me one. All I am saying is that relationships are hard and the other person takes time. They have their own pros and cons and it takes patience to be with that person. A lot of patience. Especially in a long distance relationship.
5/25/19, 8:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Had I been there in front of you. I would have sat down in front of you and looked you in the eye and said sorry but what can I do from here.
5/25/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: Well how many times have I asked you to give up anything because I have needed you? What are you trying to say with that? Telling me of times when I haven't been there for you when you didn't even ask for it? You say you don't mean I shouldn't feel hurt or that I owe you one but it sounds like you do. And you seem to think that the theater and dance classes were just random hobbies to me. Do you not understand how lonely I have been? Those have been the moments when I have had a chance to meet other people who share some same interests. I spent all spring studying alone in the library, exactly once I had a conversation with the other lady studying for the same exam. Other interactions with people were saying hi and goodbye to the librarians. I maybe more introverted than some other people but it doesn't mean I want to be alone all the time. And it's not easy for me to just start conversations with anyone. The classes were a really good chance to actually get to know some people and do something with them. You may say that I could've done that with my family. But it is not easy, Mikko and dad are more introverted than me, Laura was super busy and mum was having her own problems. Those classes were a chance to spend time with people and not to worry for a while and feel like a human being. And they were twice a week.
I really empathize with you for having those struggles yourself. It must've been incredibly hard, and I'm sorry you had to go through them. I didn't even know how bad it was. But please remember that all this while it hasn't been easy on me either. I went through many emotions while writing this reply and now the beginning seems a bit harsh. But I don't think I should censor it because I can't find a kinder way to say it now after reading it again. It's difficult to be kind when agitated. I'm not agitated anymore
5/25/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: And I don't mean to neglect the countless times you have been there for me. I remember those too and I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
5/25/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You just said it. The classes were important to _you_ and yes I am exactly trying to say that you haven't been there for me, when I have not said that I need you. And may be you do owe me one. And by owing me one I don't mean you can't feel hurt but by owing me one. I mean, giving me a chance to speak for myself. When you go for a class and interact with people and you say that you do that because you needed human contact and you choose to do that over a man who is thinking of stabbing himself then yes I mean exactly that you owe me one. Being too good can hurt. Alain De botton said that. And that is exactly I think is what is happening to me. You think you are hurt? I am too. Because I can't freely talk to my girlfriend about who I am because I am afraid that she will judge me. You are hurt, I am hurt too, because my girlfriend can't see that I can't anyhow make up for what I have done rn and she is not giving me any lead on her whatsoever. I am very kind and generous man. But I am also a pervert. And if my efforts are not a testament of that and you still are going to be shocked in the recovery period when everytime I talk to you and tell you the truth then let's not talk for a few months and let me contact you when I am a perfect man. Because it seems like you will always be disturbed so badly in these attempts that you will lose your sanity. You want me to change but you cant see me fail. And if that is the case then I beg you please let's not talk for a few days and let me think what I can do to magically change me so that your sanity is intact and you feel positive. However so agitated, frustrated or depressed I am. 



And hey, if you are hurt, I am too, and i am ready to make up for it, if you aren't then I am sorry there is nothing much I can do about it.
5/25/19, 9:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was also hurt when before the exam you repeatedly kept charging at me. Each time driving everything in the most wrong manner. Did I complain?
5/25/19, 9:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No.
5/25/19, 9:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I did not.
5/25/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did I feel hurt
5/25/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/25/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did I let you speak
5/25/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/25/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because there is no other way!!!!!
5/25/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In a long distance relationship there is none.
5/25/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd Hanna. If that is how hurt you are then please let's take a break and let me change myself. I can't see there is any other way in which I can not hurt you.
5/25/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you and I can't see you this hurt
5/25/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As much as I want to talk to you each day
5/25/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I still can't see you this hurt
5/25/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am willing to go to any lengths to make this work.
5/25/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: It is simply not fair to say I chose something over something else if I didn't even know about the other. I don't want you to be perfect, no one is I know that. Now it just feels that I'm not allowed to feel hurt about this. If you know how not to feel hurt then please share your wisdom with me. It will go away but I can't have a moment with that feeling? I should just shove it all somewhere and ignore it? I did that for 22 years and it did pretty bad damage
5/25/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well appreciation is a very formal word in this context.  It's not a business relationship. It works both ways. Don't appreciate, let the other person at least speak in return.
5/25/19, 10:07 PM - Shona 😍: I don't understand the second sentence
5/25/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well you kept taking everything in the most wrong eay
5/25/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *way
5/25/19, 10:09 PM - Shona 😍: Well excuse me if my English is not as good. It's like my heart healed a little every time you did that.
5/25/19, 10:11 PM - Shona 😍: Your way is the only right way?
5/25/19, 10:11 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry that I'm not perfect either
5/25/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You didn't know about the other? If I think you need me and I travel all the way to DELHI so that I am available for you to speak to me? Did you ask for that? Was it your job to tell me that you need me?! 
No. I got that. It was obvious. 

Need I tell you what I was going through? Hanna. Stop and take a moment and try to think what you are saying. You knew exactly what my state was. And hobby classes were not the only times, your schedule, your everything and your every decision counts. I put up with your robot like schedule and I respected that even when I needed you emotionally. And that I what I am trying to say.
5/25/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh so you think that it's a name game now?
5/25/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't you confess it yourself?
5/25/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you were talking negative?
5/25/19, 10:13 PM - Shona 😍: Yes but I tried to avoid it on the final days
5/25/19, 10:13 PM - Shona 😍: How the heck does one change everything about their thinking in a few days
5/25/19, 10:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen. Please stay with the feeling. It's all but yours. I am no one to comment.
5/25/19, 10:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh? You think so?
5/25/19, 10:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I shouldn't have felt hurt because you tried?
5/25/19, 10:16 PM - Shona 😍: You felt hurt because I was thinking negatively about the exam? And I wasn't that negative on the final days
5/25/19, 10:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No I am not talking about that
5/25/19, 10:17 PM - Shona 😍: What then?
5/25/19, 10:20 PM - Shona 😍: I did not know you were pulling your hair out or that you had suicidal thoughts. And I didn't know talking with me would've helped with that
5/25/19, 10:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well then I am sorry it's not your fault
5/25/19, 10:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am expecting too much
5/25/19, 10:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The conversation after which you said that you are sorry and that you are at my feet
5/25/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That was the only word I could think of. I feel ashamed of what I've done. I feel like sitting at your feet.
5/25/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This
5/25/19, 10:23 PM - Shona 😍: But what did you still feel hurt about after that?
5/25/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's what I am asking. Because you kept trying to be negative. I shouldn't feel hurt after that if in case you were being negative?
5/25/19, 10:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because that this what this explanation  means to me.
5/25/19, 10:26 PM - Shona 😍: Trust me I did not try to be negative. That was the autopilot. Trying not to be negative was and is more like a fight
5/25/19, 10:26 PM - Shona 😍: I don't understand
5/25/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So? I still was hurt Shona. But still I took it with a pinch of salt and I kept trying
5/25/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And now when I am having a moment of the same autopilot that I am desperately trying to change
5/25/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You won't even talk to me?
5/25/19, 10:32 PM - Shona 😍: I felt hurt I didn't know what to do!!
5/25/19, 10:32 PM - Shona 😍: I cried desperately for a good while and didn't know what to do with myself
5/25/19, 10:33 PM - Shona 😍: And somehow it felt like I'm not allowed to feel hurt
5/25/19, 10:33 PM - Shona 😍: During the call
5/25/19, 10:33 PM - Shona 😍: And before that
5/25/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I need a break.. not because I am rethinking the relationship but clearly because there is some problem with me.
5/25/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like I don't even know when you say that
5/25/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I need to learn more about it and think about it
5/25/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And clearly you want to be with the emotion too
5/25/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And by that I don't know what I do that makes you or everyone feel that
5/25/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And this is not the first time someone has said that to me
5/25/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or that
5/25/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have tried being empathetic
5/25/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have tried being considerate
5/25/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I guess it has not been enough
5/25/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And on top of it
5/25/19, 10:36 PM - Shona 😍: Many times you have
5/25/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being a pervert doesn't help
5/25/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: Been that
5/25/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please. Don't.
5/25/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: It is true
5/25/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to cover up for me.
5/25/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: Trust me I'm not
5/25/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It doesn't matter
5/25/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A thousand rights don't make up for a blunder
5/25/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And right now. This seems more than  a blunder
5/25/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a crime if no less
5/25/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me penalise myself for it.
5/25/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me analyze my mistakes
5/25/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe you are right
5/25/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it's only my fault
5/25/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I am the pervert
5/25/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And also inconsiderate
5/25/19, 10:39 PM - Shona 😍: That's too harsh
5/25/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you just are innocent and thus hurt
5/25/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. It's a Hindi saying and I believe in that.
5/25/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You kill someone and then you open a charity
5/25/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Those are not the same things
5/25/19, 10:40 PM - Shona 😍: The point is that many times you have been considerate and empathetic. At other times not. It's not all bad like you make it sound
5/25/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Sorry for my harsh words. I will correct them
5/25/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am being a very harsh person rn
5/25/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: By forcing myself on you
5/25/19, 10:41 PM - Shona 😍: Well that's true. But sounds kinda extreme comparison
5/25/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When clearly you are hurt
5/25/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A real life example
5/25/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My point being. There is no way I can say anything or do anything to make up for what I did or felt.
5/25/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am the person at fault and I need to analyze my mistakes.
5/25/19, 10:43 PM - Shona 😍: What I felt today was that there is no room for me feeling hurt about this and that you need me to be okay with it right away. And I think that's too much. And that's something that I've felt before
5/25/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deserve better.
5/25/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Believe me.
5/25/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen. I don't think this is a very sensible conversation.
5/25/19, 10:45 PM - Shona 😍: I say it again. Many times you have been empathetic too. It's when it has been something about you, like you relapsing with porn and now. Then I have felt like I can't feel hurt
5/25/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's talk tomorrow. I have popped my pills. Let me be by my sedated self. Apparently he is a more likeable and presentable  version.
5/25/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night.
5/25/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can write to me if you want.
5/25/19, 10:46 PM - Shona 😍: I love you.
5/25/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I do too.
5/25/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am disappointed.
5/25/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not with you.
5/25/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course it's me again
5/25/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
5/25/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: God bless you
5/25/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Take care.
5/26/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: Good night rakas. It's not only you. We are both human and we have our differences. It's not easy to piece it all together.
5/26/19, 8:11 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
5/26/19, 8:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning my darling
5/26/19, 8:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A very very good morning
5/26/19, 8:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May your day be as bright as your face
5/26/19, 8:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And be filled with opportunities as your heart is with warmth
5/26/19, 8:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May your life be full of love as your eyes are with innocence
5/26/19, 8:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May your
5/26/19, 8:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok I am out of may yours.. 🤣
5/26/19, 8:14 AM - Shona 😍: Where is this coming from?
5/26/19, 8:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Out of the love that I have for you. I woke up and I wanted to kiss your forehead. In Indian context kissing someone's forehead means blessing someone. Blessing them happiness and prosperity and everything good. I couldn't kiss your forehead and hence I wished you all that 
This is also something that people all round the world usually do, wish someone to have a good day and send them morning quotes.
Also, I love you and I just felt like writing something for you so unconsciously my fingers started typing it.
5/26/19, 8:18 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/26/19, 8:18 AM - Shona 😍: I'm sad
5/26/19, 8:18 AM - Shona 😍: I wish you a lovely day too.
5/26/19, 8:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please can we speak on call?
5/26/19, 8:19 AM - Shona 😍: Ok...
5/26/19, 9:45 AM - Shona 😍: I think dad is in the study next to this bathroom so I will not talk much
5/26/19, 9:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Me neither
5/26/19, 9:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing
5/26/19, 9:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just picked the phone to see you better
5/26/19, 9:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You see I really really like that color on you
5/26/19, 10:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Especially when I think how slowly I would want to take it off you
5/26/19, 10:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want me to?
5/26/19, 10:00 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
5/26/19, 10:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know what I would want to do after I take it off
5/26/19, 10:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nimbe
5/26/19, 10:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *nimble
5/26/19, 10:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not a good time
5/26/19, 10:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry
5/26/19, 11:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was nice.
5/26/19, 11:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The morning talk
5/26/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: It was
5/26/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: I'm still smiling
5/26/19, 11:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/26/19, 11:22 AM - Shona 😍: Pusu
5/26/19, 11:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙃🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃😇🙃🙂🙃
5/26/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: And nice shirt
5/26/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: Or kurta
5/26/19, 11:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't feel like working at all. Also half the things are not working and I feel like going home. But there is just not a work environment at home. The AC is not working here and I kinda feel like asking them to switch it on just for one person on the entire floor.
5/26/19, 11:28 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm. If it's unbearable ask them to switch it on
5/26/19, 11:29 AM - Shona 😍: I'm reading a story in our newspaper about an Indian IT guy who came to Finland
5/26/19, 11:30 AM - Shona 😍: He first worked in an Indian company
5/26/19, 11:30 AM - Shona 😍: Fell in love with a Finn
5/26/19, 11:30 AM - Shona 😍: Switched to a Finnish company
5/26/19, 11:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭
5/26/19, 11:30 AM - Shona 😍: The Indian companies apparently pay much less
5/26/19, 11:30 AM - Shona 😍: For such workers
5/26/19, 11:31 AM - Shona 😍: There's even a photo of their engagement party in India 😄
5/26/19, 11:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I got a fan 😎
5/26/19, 11:34 AM - Shona 😍: I'm glad you got a propeller
5/26/19, 11:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are just.  🙊🙊🙊
5/26/19, 11:37 AM - Shona 😍: 😗
5/26/19, 11:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can we video call
5/26/19, 11:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I will not talk but
5/26/19, 11:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like we used to do it when we were studying together?
5/26/19, 11:39 AM - Shona 😍: Sure :)

5/26/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slept for almost an hour
5/26/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On my desk
5/26/19, 3:01 PM - Shona 😍: 😄😄😄
5/26/19, 7:46 PM - Shona 😍: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/25/women-happier-without-children-or-a-spouse-happiness-expert
5/26/19, 7:46 PM - Shona 😍: Interesting
5/26/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: Though after listening to the marriage book I'm more inclined to believe the quality of the marriage is the most important factor. In the book they pointed out how the survey based research can be unreliable and they actually measured physiological markers in subjects, like the amount of white blood cells. And it was so that the happily married were healthier than single or unhappily married.
5/26/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you think our quality of marriage will be good?
5/26/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: I think it's largely up to us
5/26/19, 8:35 PM - Shona 😍: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-put-down-the-self-help-books-resilience-is-not-a-diy-endeavour/
5/26/19, 8:35 PM - Shona 😍: This was fascinating too
5/26/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: Though after reading the latter article I'm not sure anymore how much is actually up to us 😄
5/26/19, 9:18 PM - Shona 😍: What are you up to?
5/26/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Met Jordan
5/26/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Played PUBg

5/26/19, 9:30 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
5/26/19, 9:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The cozier one wants me to book it directly and says that it's against Airbnb policy to check it out before booking
5/26/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: Oh?
5/26/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: Well it did say on the website that address will be given after booking
5/26/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: Which one did you like better?

5/26/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And nothing is more convenient than that
5/26/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: Alright
5/26/19, 10:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You feel like talking but don't have much to say?

5/26/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can text

5/26/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No nothing specific
5/26/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just something related to the fact
5/26/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I love you
5/26/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And may be if we can make a conversation out of it

5/26/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am jumping a lot while playing Frisbee these days. Gives me ideas as to what we can do with the extra stamina
5/26/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I don't want to talk sex rn
5/26/19, 10:36 PM - Shona 😍: Okay. I came real nice earlier in the evening
5/26/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean let's discuss something real nice.
5/26/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤗
5/26/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I used to ask this question a lot to people
5/26/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah let's talk about something else. But I'll just say I was watching the video you sent last Sunday and for the first time I was really aroused by it. I mean I have been before but it was slightly different. It was interesting.
5/26/19, 10:38 PM - Shona 😍: What question?
5/26/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
5/26/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How much do you love me.
5/26/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: People always keep saying that I love you and all but I am always curious as to what it means to different people and is there a certain way in which we can defne it or compare it.
5/26/19, 10:39 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm yes
5/26/19, 10:40 PM - Shona 😍: Just a sec I really gotta pee that'll require some thinking I'll be back
5/26/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thanks for the honesty
5/26/19, 10:41 PM - Shona 😍: You are most welcome
5/26/19, 10:42 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if it's possible to define it with words. I was actually thinking about love and what it means when I was cleaning at the office
5/26/19, 10:43 PM - Shona 😍: Where to start
5/26/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. So good timing I guess.
5/26/19, 10:44 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah!
5/26/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please say.
5/26/19, 10:53 PM - Shona 😍: I used to think to love is to give up your everything for the one you love. And in a way that seems like a beautiful idea. It was also related to religion and I thought about it mostly related to God. And the example given by Jesus to die for all people, even for those that hated him. It is quite a radical idea imo. To die for the people who you love and who love you seems more understandable but to die for your enemies as well... It is a peculiar idea. But I think that was mostly what I was taught about love growing up. Of course my parents love was there too but I think it's a Finnish thing not to use the word love much. You only say it when you really mean it, and it is not just about a feeling but some kind of deep caring for the other.
Then with this relationship I have learned something very new. The way you have loved me is something almost indescribable. I never knew before what it could be. What I mean by that is that I had heard about others talk about it and read about it but experiencing it yourself is something very different obviously. And then thinking about what loving you means to me... That's still something I'm figuring out I think. I mean I think I'm learning
5/26/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: I guess what gets me confused is all the advice that you shouldn't really give up your everything but you need to look after yourself because no one else will at the end of the day. And that seems somehow quite sad
5/26/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you think I do that?
5/26/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Think about myself?
5/26/19, 10:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or do you want to do that?
5/26/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: I honestly don't even know what that would practically even mean
5/26/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: Other than in the case of dying for someone
5/26/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: Like the living part is the difficult to understand
5/26/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: What does that look like in life
5/26/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow I don't think it would really work in a relationship. If the other one gives up everything, then they just disappear into the other person. What kind of life is that? For either of the partners?
5/26/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: And there are many ways to understand that but I mean it very practically
5/26/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: I also used to think that the perfect balance will be found when both partners are willing to do the same for one another
5/26/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: So each is taken care of in the best possible way
5/26/19, 11:09 PM - Shona 😍: And maybe that can be the ideal
5/26/19, 11:09 PM - Shona 😍: But we are all human and fall short of perfect
5/26/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: I think that was my definition before, how I thought about what I'd want to have
5/26/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: What do you think?
5/26/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In the case for Nelli. For her to live. Would you want to give up yoursm
5/26/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *?
5/26/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exactly
5/26/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See to me, love is that I should completely give myself up for the other person.
5/26/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's my definite definition of love
5/26/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Self sacrifice
5/26/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Self dissolution
5/26/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I never imagined
5/26/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That life is so simple
5/26/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That it's so elegant a solution
5/26/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .this. is perfect
5/26/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: If I'm being completely honest with myself I don't think I could do it for an animal. Even for Nelli. I mean if she was drowning or something, I think I would jump in if I thought I could save her... But if it was just a simple question of me dying rn for her to live, I wouldn't.
5/26/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: Practical example. What if you liked Mexican food and I liked Chinese food, would you always be willing to have Chinese food because I like it? Without thinking that now I owe something or I should give up something else in return? Is it possible not to feel that, if it were to happen every single time for years? Obviously if I love you I will think of what you like too and we will have both foods and do other things but in the case of the other person not doing it
5/26/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course if you don't do it then I just can't effortlessly go and do things and I think that is exactly why people date. To see these things for first hand.
5/26/19, 11:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you are going to be cold hearted and use my innocence to your advantage then someday I am going to realize that and snap
5/26/19, 11:30 PM - Shona 😍: I can very well understand that and I think that's only natural. But I think that's something different than complete self sacrifice then
5/26/19, 11:31 PM - Shona 😍: So in that way I don't think the complete self sacrifice should be a goal
5/26/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
5/26/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Download Hago

5/27/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah!

I really liked our conversation yesterday and I will make it a point to try to talk earlier and not let things come between us for days. I can't wait to be there. The airbnb houses looked wonderful, I hope other one will work for us. Also I think it's quite funny you slept at your desk for an hour yesterday! Wasn't it horribly uncomfortable or were you able to adjust the chair somehow?
Tomorrow is the day for Nelli. I try to spend time with her today and tomorrow in the day. Yesterday we took her swimming for the last time and she really enjoyed her time there. We also napped together and that was ❤
5/27/19, 12:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hope you get to spend as much time. Can't you delay it? Wait for it to happen naturally?
5/27/19, 12:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel so bad.
5/27/19, 12:19 PM - Shona 😍: Shona she's in a lot of pain and on strong medication

5/27/19, 2:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Someday someone is going to walk to to me as well and tell me not to do it
5/27/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So are you all going to sleep on the matress today?
5/27/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *floor

5/27/19, 6:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, ever since I started lieing to you/or hiding  about weed I realized I shouldn't have done it. It was not worth it. Not only did we spoke less after that, I actually have not been communicating properly with you.

5/27/19, 6:49 PM - Shona 😍: Or do you mean earlier

5/27/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want to drift apart
5/27/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was a fool to do so
5/27/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please take me back 😭

5/29/19, 8:21 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know if I have much anything to say
5/29/19, 8:21 AM - Shona 😍: I'm not in a good mood

5/29/19, 6:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My intern my studies my dreams myself
5/29/19, 6:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I don't know why I am going with Faizal
5/29/19, 6:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe because in the past I have known that this is not good
5/29/19, 6:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And this results in it going away
5/29/19, 6:05 PM - Shona 😍: Go out with Faizal. I think it'll be good for you. I'm in a really shitty mood anyway and I think it'll take time to pass
5/29/19, 6:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that's the thing, we either only talk in our shitty moods or we never talk
5/29/19, 6:10 PM - Shona 😍: I will try to gather myself and write to you?

5/29/19, 6:11 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
5/29/19, 6:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I don't know if I can stand something this difficult
5/29/19, 6:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Each day I just feel like killing myself

5/29/19, 6:12 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too. I'm sorry it's all been so hard on you too. My problems in addition to your own ones. And having to deal with it all via messages and calls for so long
5/29/19, 6:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will just be a friend who hold hands and go on long walks
5/29/19, 6:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd I can live with taht

5/29/19, 6:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like going down on my knees

5/29/19, 6:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Any fucking way
5/29/19, 6:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To get to you
5/29/19, 6:14 PM - Shona 😍: Let's make the next distance part shorter. After July.
5/29/19, 6:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Your problems and my problems I am all for. What I can't handle are the not -so-benign thoughts that come to my mind and fill me with guilt
5/29/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously Shona. You know somewhere in December. This was also something that I was thinking before going to Vipasana. That maybe I will get control over my thoughts and will be able to control such unwanted thoughts.
5/29/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am such a shameless person.
5/29/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😭😭😭
5/29/19, 6:16 PM - Shona 😍: Well what can you do about thoughts. They come and go. You can share them with me if it makes it easier and I will handle it on my part
5/29/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No!
5/29/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will break us apart
5/29/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then if i don't
5/29/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like I am faking this relationship
5/29/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Uuuuuhh
5/29/19, 6:17 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
5/29/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I once saw a black mirror episode
5/29/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In which the mother was able to
5/29/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Censor all the things from the child's vision she wanted to.
5/29/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish I had tgat
5/29/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or may be just the blinkers that horses have.
5/29/19, 6:19 PM - Shona 😍: Are you talking about checking out other people again?
5/29/19, 6:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And what follows after that.
5/29/19, 6:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am a horrible person
5/29/19, 6:20 PM - Shona 😍: I think that's just normal. We've been with the distance for months
5/29/19, 6:21 PM - Shona 😍: And I think the feeling of guilt and thinking that you shouldn't think that makes it even worse, makes you think it more
5/29/19, 6:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes it does
5/29/19, 6:25 PM - Shona 😍: I occasionally have such thoughts too
5/29/19, 6:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You do?
5/29/19, 6:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🥺
5/29/19, 6:25 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I try to observe them then. But not pay too much attention. Then I just think about you
5/29/19, 6:26 PM - Shona 😍: But I think if I were to feel guilty about it, I would think about it 10000x more and give it way too much of mental energy
5/29/19, 6:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is exactly what happens to me
5/29/19, 6:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It hampers my productivity
5/29/19, 6:27 PM - Shona 😍: And that's horrible
5/29/19, 6:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel better now.b
5/29/19, 6:29 PM - Shona 😍: What I tell myself is that I just gotta be patient, I'll get to do such things with you soon
5/29/19, 6:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why is it that talking to you even about how to make popcorn makes me feel better
5/29/19, 6:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🥺🥺
5/29/19, 6:30 PM - Shona 😍: Are you gonna make popcorn? :D
5/29/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you feel better to
5/29/19, 6:30 PM - Shona 😍: I actually do!
5/29/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No I just wanted to mention it as a pointless argument
5/29/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby!

5/29/19, 6:32 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>

5/29/19, 6:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sure he doesn't have it
5/29/19, 6:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the thing is
5/29/19, 6:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am looking for something cheaper
5/29/19, 6:45 PM - Shona 😍: Baby. That's too much for me. And I think he would actually feel bad. Because of our agreement, I don't know how well he'll receive anything
5/29/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you all were to contribute
5/29/19, 7:10 PM - Shona 😍: I think mum and dad have a gift of their own

5/29/19, 10:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/29/19, 10:33 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah! I agree it was wise to start doing that. I think you're better off and so are they. If no one gets anything positive out of the relationship then what's the point. All of you have better suited people for you to spend time with

5/30/19, 5:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you ok?
5/30/19, 5:18 PM - Shona 😍: It was a new unit again so most of my mental space went to finding my way around and getting everything done on time. Also I hung out with my coworker, I'm trying to socialize a bit more. And it's a psychiatric hospital do I'm kinda fascinated by the patients. Each unit has different kind of patients and I find myself wondering what are the stories of the people there. These patients today were roughly my age. Also why I'm kinda focused to work is that I need to be alert, some patients are in a pretty bad condition and the staff has told me that there have been some dangerous situations too. Until now it's been all fine and I haven't witnessed anything more special than someone yelling threats at the nursing staff. But I'm kinda glad I'm not a small person so that I feel quite safe and confident that I can defend myself if needed. And all the knives in the kitchen are stored behind locks so everyone should be relatively safe anyway.

5/30/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am happy that I can finally be an inspiration to you
5/30/19, 9:03 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
5/30/19, 9:03 PM - Shona 😍: ❤.
5/30/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can. You will have to be a little professional tho
5/30/19, 9:04 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if I like the idea though
5/30/19, 9:05 PM - Shona 😍: Let's see how much I can do on my own. I've been able to do quite a lot by myself
5/30/19, 9:05 PM - Shona 😍: With other things that is
5/30/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not sure I understand what you mean
5/30/19, 9:10 PM - Shona 😍: Just saying that often I can motivate myself enough
5/30/19, 9:10 PM - Shona 😍: I like language learning
5/30/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: Can we talk if I go on the walk now?
5/30/19, 9:15 PM - Shona 😍: Or maybe that's just an illusion that I have. Because at some point I do run out of the motivation too
5/30/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yea
5/30/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No that is seeing a black and white situation
5/30/19, 9:26 PM - Shona 😍: True
5/30/19, 9:28 PM - Shona 😍: I'm just thinking that having someone I'm accountable would help motivate me to go an extra mile
5/30/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/30/19, 10:29 PM - Shona 😍: 🤹🏼‍♂
5/30/19, 10:30 PM - Shona 😍: I think I'm gonna take a shower
5/30/19, 10:34 PM - Shona 😍: Baby
5/30/19, 10:34 PM - Shona 😍: I mich yu
5/30/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I do too
5/30/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Talking has been good.
5/30/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry the house has really really been full of people
5/30/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Else I would have talked more peacefully
5/30/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But there was something else I was thinking
5/30/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Whenever I want to talk to you
5/30/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I like being alone and
5/30/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I have observed doesn't work well for me
5/30/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I get depressed too often when I am alone
5/30/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: However, even if I am depressed and am surrounded by people
5/30/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will get better
5/30/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it's me
5/30/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it's the kind of people
5/30/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the point is
5/30/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That keeping in mind that I want to talk to you more.
5/30/19, 10:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I should have taken a single room
5/30/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And stayed there
5/30/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But having said that
5/30/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I still enjoy living with these people
5/30/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: After living in my hostel room alone for such a long time
5/30/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think this is good
5/30/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like yesterday
5/30/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With Faizal
5/30/19, 10:38 PM - Shona 😍: Yes. I think that was a good solution for this period
5/30/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would have sulked
5/30/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Had I been on my own
5/30/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But being with him
5/30/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just being for a single second
5/30/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Gives me so much pleasant moments
5/30/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The talks.
5/30/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They are so silly
5/30/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really like it
5/30/19, 10:39 PM - Shona 😍: :)
5/30/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You Finn
5/30/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I type so much
5/30/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you...
5/30/19, 10:40 PM - Shona 😍: He seems to be a good friend for you
5/30/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He is.
5/30/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Achha suno
5/30/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like being selfish
5/30/19, 10:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you know what I mean
5/30/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I already feel sleepy
5/30/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭
5/30/19, 10:41 PM - Shona 😍: I understand
5/30/19, 10:41 PM - Shona 😍: But I don't really feel like touching myself rn.
5/30/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Excuse me.
5/30/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A question
5/30/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If that is the case
5/30/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then I don't think either of us is going to come.
5/30/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤪
5/30/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Isn't it?
5/30/19, 10:42 PM - Shona 😍: You tell me
5/30/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think not
5/30/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you don't want me to tell you a dirty story?
5/30/19, 10:44 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not in the mood
5/30/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/30/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am barely able to open my eyes.
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I sleep?
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not selfish
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's just that after this it won't be until another hour and a half
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Shona 😍: Sleep shonq
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Before I feel sleepy
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Shona 😍: I knooooow
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Shona 😍: SLEEP
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Shona 😍: 😗
5/30/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't take me as selfish
5/30/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you. Good night
5/30/19, 10:46 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too baby
5/30/19, 10:46 PM - Shona 😍: Good night
5/31/19, 7:31 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning kulta
5/31/19, 7:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A very very very good morning to you my love.
5/31/19, 7:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Have a fresh day ahead
5/31/19, 7:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/31/19, 7:55 AM - Shona 😍: Same to you ✨
5/31/19, 7:55 AM - Shona 😍: 😗
5/31/19, 7:55 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
5/31/19, 7:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙈
5/31/19, 8:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sharam aana in Hindi literally means to get shyness. Yeah, that is how its phrased. So when I say sharam, I mean I am getting shy. And then wheni sat sharam while getting shy I say it Cham. So this 🙊 means Cham.
5/31/19, 8:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
5/31/19, 8:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Cham 🙊
5/31/19, 8:30 AM - Shona 😍: 🤭🤭
5/31/19, 8:34 AM - Shona 😍: Now I would just want to kiss you all over your face. Like I did when you were here. Forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, lips... PUCCHAS
5/31/19, 8:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And back at you
5/31/19, 8:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am shy
5/31/19, 8:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But occasionally
5/31/19, 8:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I uhide my face
5/31/19, 8:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Quickly kiss you all over
5/31/19, 8:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I hid again
5/31/19, 8:37 AM - Shona 😍: 😚😚😚😚😚😚😚
5/31/19, 9:00 AM - Shona 😍: Playing Duolingo is the perfect activity for the bus ride!! I practised the whole time
5/31/19, 9:00 AM - Shona 😍: And it's f u n
5/31/19, 9:01 AM - Shona 😍: Also seeing other people's scores makes it competitive and I wanna beat them 😁
5/31/19, 9:08 AM - Shona 😍: Beware soon I'm gonna make you listen and I'm gonna sound like a two year old
5/31/19, 9:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
5/31/19, 9:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a question for you
5/31/19, 9:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When do you eliminate stuff
5/31/19, 9:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Basically when do you throw it out
5/31/19, 9:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok maybe not stuff
5/31/19, 9:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Habits
5/31/19, 9:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like how did you decide what to do with those things that you stopped doing in the morning
5/31/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: What stuff do you mean? Any of the habits? Like writing the intention or cold showers?
5/31/19, 11:42 AM - Shona 😍: It depends. Now when I had to start waking up much earlier for work I just didn't have it in me to wake up even earlier to write the intention. And I also thought it's not as important for this work. But now that I'm starting to get used to waking up that early I think it might be a good idea to start doing it again. The cold showers I took to wake up for studying and I did it for months every morning except for some Sundays and Saturdays. Now I'm mostly being physically active when working so I feel that it wakes me up enough. The stretching I did in the morning in January just didn't seem a good use of time in the morning, I thought it's better to use the morning energy on studying. Meditation... That also started to feel like a waste of time in the morning. Though I did that too at least for a month. Maybe I could start doing it some other time in the day but I'm not sure how to find the motivation. I didn't see that big of a difference.
So why I stop:
-Adjusting period to a new schedule
-I feel that the habit doesn't serve a purpose anymore, at all or at the time I'm used to doing it
-Lack of motivation
And I try adding new things whenI feel that something' s not quite working or I hear about s new habit that I think might be useful
5/31/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: Why do you ask?
5/31/19, 3:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will tell you later.
5/31/19, 7:01 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry I'm gonna vent a bit
5/31/19, 7:01 PM - Shona 😍: But god damn it I hate that job
5/31/19, 7:02 PM - Shona 😍: It's so boring my brain is dying and yet it's tiring because of the physical activity so I don't have much energy afterwards to read
5/31/19, 7:02 PM - Shona 😍: It feels like a complete waste of time
5/31/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: What do I even need the money for I still have some previous savings
5/31/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: Ok maybe I'm also not eating enough, maybe that would bring more energy for other things. I do need more than when I was sitting all day studying
5/31/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
5/31/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can we talk?
5/31/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You sure you don't want to say more?
5/31/19, 7:24 PM - Shona 😍: Yea
5/31/19, 7:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me reach home.
5/31/19, 7:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>

5/31/19, 7:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Look at the gif
5/31/19, 7:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
5/31/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it clear now?
5/31/19, 7:38 PM - Shona 😍: Yes I remember such graphs
5/31/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
5/31/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As compared to this
5/31/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Imagine how a wave will move
5/31/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Every point will move from a range of -amplitude to +amplitude
5/31/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But see the nodal points
5/31/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They don't move at all
5/31/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So they are standing where they are
5/31/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is like the whole wave is stationary
5/31/19, 7:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it is not moving forward
5/31/19, 7:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Unlike usual waves
5/31/19, 7:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In this fountain waves are moving like the general waves. Forward or backwards. But ripples
5/31/19, 7:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But this is a special case of a standing or a stationary wave in which the nodes and antinodes are right there. Clearly distinct
5/31/19, 7:43 PM - Shona 😍: Uh huh
5/31/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is that anguish?
5/31/19, 7:43 PM - Shona 😍: 🌊
5/31/19, 7:45 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I don't know enough about the waves to really appreciate it.
5/31/19, 7:45 PM - Shona 😍: But yeah it's cool
5/31/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok maybe you are also not in the mood
5/31/19, 7:46 PM - Shona 😍: Also that :D
5/31/19, 7:46 PM - Shona 😍: I was gonna vent more
5/31/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go on
5/31/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: Yesterday mum asked what am I gonna do if I don't get into med school. That made me realize I haven't thought that through and I don't have a proper plan b. I have couple ideas only. Rn it feels like I'm wasting 10h a day and I don't have energy to be very productive afterwards. 8h for work and almost 2h for commute. Sure I can learn Hindi in the morning but on my way back it was really difficult I felt so sleepy.
5/31/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: And I can't drink coffee or tea in 2 weeks so that the teeth won't stain and that's  h o r r i b l e. Having tea often soothes me
5/31/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: And coffee is just ❤
5/31/19, 7:53 PM - Shona 😍: Sure this is only for two more weeks but it feels like such a waste
5/31/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. I will reply to all those in a few minutes
5/31/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But please tell me more
5/31/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You remember how February was for me?
5/31/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Every instant felt like such a damn waste. Such a fucking damn waste.
5/31/19, 7:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I look back at my days these days and I can't believe that I was thinking of giving up my life if this is what awaited me.
5/31/19, 7:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not saying me giving all this Gyan(knowledge :D) makes it any easier for you
5/31/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you had a great great 4 months after I left for India. You did Bahngra, theater classes, the studying and the effeciency but baby, sometimes life is just boring. Sometimes you have to do somethings. for eg all the 🏠 hold stuff that I had to take care off after my semester ended.
5/31/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: Sure. I don't mean to belittle what you went through back then. But I think it was a different type struggle that you had so I don't know if the same advice works. I'm literally cleaning piss and shit for every euro rn
5/31/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Fine. Agreed.
5/31/19, 7:59 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
5/31/19, 7:59 PM - Shona 😍: Okay it's also funny
5/31/19, 7:59 PM - Shona 😍: It's not
5/31/19, 7:59 PM - Shona 😍: I dunno
5/31/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is?
5/31/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But lets not laugh at it
5/31/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's discuss
5/31/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But ever so less seriously?
5/31/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that we can talk about it neutrally?
5/31/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if that's possible but sure
5/31/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or we can talk about something else rn and we can discuss the crappy part when it's a cold topic
5/31/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometimes neglecting a problem is also an alternative
5/31/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm but something I've learned at work is that the crap doesn't go away unless you clean it 😂
5/31/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok I am talking while I am writing so it's like I am talking to you and now I can't wait for you to be here. But wait. I am walking on a road and it is dusty so I don't know if you will like it since it's so polluted
5/31/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: You're talking what you're writing or talking with someone else?
5/31/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The former
5/31/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: Well I'm not gonna like the pollution, who does, but maybe the road is nice
5/31/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
5/31/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I worked almost 10 hours today
5/31/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ♥
5/31/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: 🎉
5/31/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: Wow
5/31/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But lets talk about your day
5/31/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
5/31/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: It's also the atmosphere. The people that I work with complain a lot
5/31/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a history of walking over your feelings
5/31/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: At least today
5/31/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: Not everyone does
5/31/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/31/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: :(

5/31/19, 8:24 PM - Shona 😍: Just kill me please
5/31/19, 8:24 PM - Shona 😍: At least the office is nice to clean and they pay well
5/31/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: And I get to listen to audiobooks or podcasts
5/31/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: Ok please tell me about your day so that I can at least be happy for how you are doing
5/31/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. That can be an alternative
5/31/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Call
5/31/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ?
5/31/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: Couple times now I've had the horrible rum raisin ice cream we bought together in like November or something
5/31/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: I don't really like it
5/31/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: But for some reason I like having it
5/31/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: Just couple spoonfuls
5/31/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: It reminds me of our time here
5/31/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: And it tastes quite interesting
5/31/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if you remember
5/31/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe it's also gone kinda bad by now 😁
5/31/19, 9:43 PM - Shona 😍: I still don't have a gift for Mikko 😅
5/31/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Also, do you really want these kind of headphones that I have? Or similar ones?
5/31/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
5/31/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. I just about to make a deal with Amit.
5/31/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He might give me his nose
5/31/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *bose
5/31/19, 9:50 PM - Shona 😍: You want his nose? :D
5/31/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's what we all are laughing at
5/31/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣🤣🤣
5/31/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: 😂
5/31/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want me to gift me that?
5/31/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: His nose?
5/31/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
5/31/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
5/31/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: These
5/31/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: Let the man keep his nose
5/31/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣🤣🤣
5/31/19, 9:54 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
5/31/19, 9:56 PM - Shona 😍: How much is he asking for them?
5/31/19, 9:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh that is a very very different scope
5/31/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it the shitty ice cream we got from LIDL
5/31/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You didn't let me. Now it's on you 🙄
5/31/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: I think so
5/31/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😃
5/31/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: Don't remember where we got it
5/31/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: Well your suggestion was a 250e one 😅
5/31/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I could have looked for other things.
5/31/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you didn't seem interested
5/31/19, 10:01 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
5/31/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. It's that
5/31/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It tastes like ass
5/31/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
5/31/19, 10:04 PM - Shona 😍: It's fine. I'm just not sure what to do. I mean we stilö have the agreement of not giving gifts... And Laura is giving him money. I would feel a bit weird about doing that. And now I'm thinking of getting him a bottle of Jägermeister or something 😅
5/31/19, 10:04 PM - Shona 😍: Oh God
5/31/19, 10:05 PM - Shona 😍: It just tastes like something very artificial
5/31/19, 10:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah that will be good
5/31/19, 10:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe someday you will give me a rimjob
5/31/19, 10:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is how it tastes like
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh either you can get really aroused by that
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or really disgusted
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: 😅
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hope it's the former
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: 😅
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: 😅
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😃
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: Jägermeister?
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
5/31/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Btw.
5/31/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have seen me succumb when I have had really good orgasms right?
5/31/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I do that with double the intensity. Rimjobs hyperarouse me
5/31/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Especially when they are forced
5/31/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not asking you to do it
5/31/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am just giving you feedback
5/31/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not forcing you by any means
5/31/19, 10:08 PM - Shona 😍: I can't stop myself from thinking about the hygiene part. I think I tried to google that at some point, got no answer. I mean the bacteria in the rectum is quite different from the genitals
5/31/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And neither is it my intention
5/31/19, 10:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Girl you are crazym
5/31/19, 10:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *crazy
5/31/19, 10:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously yaar
5/31/19, 10:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now I am disgusted
5/31/19, 10:09 PM - Shona 😍: But I think you can stimulate the rectum with a finger or something else too. I've read that men can indeed have more intense orgasms with that
5/31/19, 10:09 PM - Shona 😍: :D
5/31/19, 10:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Who looks for hygiene in sex
5/31/19, 10:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Uuuh🙄
5/31/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: Not hygiene
5/31/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: But if you can actually get some health issues from that
5/31/19, 10:10 PM - Shona 😍: That's the question
5/31/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Keep looking for issues.
5/31/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 👍🏻
5/31/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sure you can find some
5/31/19, 10:11 PM - Shona 😍: Keep ignoring your health and other people's health too
5/31/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then you can think about those when we have sex
5/31/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 👍🏻
5/31/19, 10:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are a freak.
5/31/19, 10:14 PM - Shona 😍: So are you
5/31/19, 10:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No I am not
5/31/19, 10:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just coz you are crazy about health issues not everyone has to be
5/31/19, 10:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know you are extra sensitive about those issues
5/31/19, 10:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Air of Delhi is equivalent to smoking 45 cigerattes a day
5/31/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hey, that's a scientific reaction
5/31/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *study
5/31/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I am sure you are not up for smoking 45 cigerattes a day
5/31/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: People in India have a very high risk of Asthma and Lung cancer
5/31/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will have it too
5/31/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe you should seriously reconsider coming to India
5/31/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because if that is your value principle of keeping health a priority
5/31/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then it should be in every case
5/31/19, 10:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am worried what this will do to you
5/31/19, 10:24 PM - Shona 😍: Obviously it can't be in everything. I'd need to live in a glass bubble or something to avoid any contamination. But when it's something easy to avoid. So I rather find out before doing things. Also, excuse me I am and always will be health conscious, I want to be a doctor for God's sake! Why do you think that is?
5/31/19, 10:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby.
5/31/19, 10:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen to me
5/31/19, 10:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sex is all about contamination
5/31/19, 10:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think there is anything healthy about putting my genitals in yours
5/31/19, 10:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There are a thousand different complications
5/31/19, 10:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You should avoid that too
5/31/19, 10:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if not then why?
5/31/19, 10:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because you want to do it?
5/31/19, 10:26 PM - Shona 😍: You are not even trying to understand
5/31/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to talk about it on call
5/31/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I guess you won't because everyone might listen
5/31/19, 10:28 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah and I'm at home so i can't talk freely
5/31/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
5/31/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻
5/31/19, 10:29 PM - Shona 😍: Obviously sex is not about contamination. That's what keeps the species alive, it needs to happen
5/31/19, 10:29 PM - Shona 😍: And that I mean just biologically
5/31/19, 10:29 PM - Shona 😍: Of course there are other aspects to it too
5/31/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want me to say it out loud what I am thinking
5/31/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sex is contamination at it's heights
5/31/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the basic assumption
5/31/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And on the basis of that I am going to say what I am going to say
5/31/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So if it is so contaminated and risky why do it at all
5/31/19, 10:34 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe we have a different definition of contamination then
5/31/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because of this
5/31/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yes I also mean biologically needs to happen
5/31/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why else will you do it?
5/31/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe because you like it?
5/31/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure that can be the case
5/31/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But oral sex is not important
5/31/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why do that then
5/31/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oral sex won't keep the species alive
5/31/19, 10:36 PM - Shona 😍: Well oral sex doesn't cause infection if both are healthy and don't have stds
5/31/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So can be with rimjobs?
5/31/19, 10:36 PM - Shona 😍: But if the rectal bacteria grows in the vagina it can cause an infection
5/31/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know!
5/31/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: It's what I've been trying to find out
5/31/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: Haven't yet
5/31/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: And I'm not saying no to it I just want to know that first
5/31/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
5/31/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think I want to do oral sex at all anymore
5/31/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At least I don't expect you to do it to me.
5/31/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will think about it if I want to
5/31/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Think what you want to.
5/31/19, 10:40 PM - Shona 😍: That's your call.
5/31/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't sound like you were sure about it.
5/31/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You were already skeptical
5/31/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am the devil if I say it
5/31/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
5/31/19, 10:43 PM - Shona 😍: About what!
5/31/19, 10:43 PM - Shona 😍: I don't understand
5/31/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About giving me blowjob
5/31/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have said it manytimes
5/31/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you were not sure about it
5/31/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you will even want to do it
5/31/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And on top of it the hygiene question
5/31/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If the decision is so questionable
5/31/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why not just avoid it altogether
5/31/19, 10:46 PM - Shona 😍: Omfg
5/31/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry for what I said.
5/31/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just replayed it in my head
5/31/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I get it
5/31/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am asking you to do something you are not comfortable doing
5/31/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There was a time when I was like that.
5/31/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can understand
5/31/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It can be scary for the first time
5/31/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you have never done it
5/31/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's much easier from my side
5/31/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What I should actually tell you si
5/31/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *is
5/31/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That those online blogs can be helpful yes
5/31/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: You seriously fight dirty
5/31/19, 10:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But they are a little too careful in what they say when it comes to sex advice,  hygiene and contraception
5/31/19, 10:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know.
5/31/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna need a breather
5/31/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: Not for days
5/31/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: Not for hours
5/31/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: But you just keep firing
5/31/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: How do you expect me not to avoid conversations when you do that
5/31/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's just say I am like that
5/31/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you see me fighting you can avoid the fight and stop me by pointing it out
5/31/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hey maybe I am like that by nature. So that's a flaw in me. But you can't avoid conversations?
5/31/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I knew how you were going to react to the me finding the lady at my workplace hot still I did that conversation
5/31/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If that's what you have been doing then we seriously need to talk
5/31/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And by talk I don't mean to fight but I can calm myself down by being conscious of the fact that I shouldn't be getting angry and then we can talk
5/31/19, 10:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But we shouldn't be avoiding topics
5/31/19, 10:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What all have you been avoiding?
5/31/19, 10:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And also you avoid conversations for multiple reasons
5/31/19, 10:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because you are at your place
5/31/19, 10:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because you generally  find it tough to initiate difficult conversations
5/31/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: You actually belittled my personality in this discussion
5/31/19, 11:04 PM - Shona 😍: It's different to discuss the topics
5/31/19, 11:04 PM - Shona 😍: And the actions
5/31/19, 11:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tell me how.
5/31/19, 11:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
5/31/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: Well I am a freak and not everyone is crazy about health issues
5/31/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: You didn't even try to understand what I meant
5/31/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Also sure
5/31/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: I am more health conscious than the average person
5/31/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah I admit it
5/31/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: But I don't think it's a bad thing or a flaw
5/31/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: It's gonna be helpful in what I want to do in life
5/31/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: Sometimes I can be over sensitive
5/31/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being health conscious is different and being a freak is going bizzerk about it. I think the latter is not good and I sincerely feel that you are the latter.
5/31/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is not belittling your personality in my opinion. That's called a flaw that I see in you and I think we all have our fair share of flaws. Like I obviously have many. Belittling someone's personality at least to me is degrading someone permanently in terms of respect and stature. I don't think I did that. This, the conversation that we are having rn is something that I have gone in my head and I don't think it was ever a pleasurable replay. So... It was just about being agitated when I am discussing the flaw because that's how I feel about it. I don't know you can make this about you.
5/31/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is maybe exactly what I am trying to say
5/31/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And maybe I will say it more explicitly so that you know where I am coming from
5/31/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: So because I don't want to lick your asshole before knowing more about it I'm the freak?
5/31/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Everything is about you I feel. Like this discussion. Yes, I didn't understand your viewpoint that, you are just taking care of our health or maybe that you are conscious since you haven't done it, but baby did you try to understand where I am coming from. Maybe there is more to it? Maybe there is something else? Instead you think I am belittling your personality
5/31/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: Can you please explain more about that? I'm not sure what all you mean. I mean this particular flaw
5/31/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know what darling, if that is how you say it and that is how you feel then please don't you ever think of doing it. I will see what I can do about it. And no I don't think you are a freak because you don't lick my asshole. I do think you are selfish. Because you won't do it because it may cause some(of which the chances are very low) infection to you and your health may deteriorate but you are not trying to understand as to how important it is to me or that how much it is valuable to the other person and then it's just a simple comparison between preferences, my heightened insensitive extra tall preferences of getting a rimjob and your heightened insensitive extra tall preferences of getting an infection when you cannot get one. I think I can't put it more simply.
5/31/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And now I know what you are thinking
5/31/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is he really comparing health to pleasure?
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is he nuts?
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does he not know that health is more important?
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I will say that no
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is not
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not to me
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then you will say
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's to you? Right?
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then that is my point
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is to you
5/31/19, 11:19 PM - Shona 😍: What do you even need me for if you already know what I'm thinking and what I'm gonna say
5/31/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's not what I meant but I cant really have a conversation in which you will stare at my conversations and curse me out loud in Finnish and won't say a word
5/31/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because it is honestly very very irritating
5/31/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To see this
5/31/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you are online and not typing
5/31/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: While I am typing epochs
5/31/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: I'm trying to think before I speak
5/31/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd all that comes out is this when you think
5/31/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
5/31/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If this image said typing here. Then I wouldn't have done the roleplay of thinking on your behalf
5/31/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But since it still doesn't say that I am going to continue
5/31/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you will say that health is more important to you. Don't I know that? And the answer is, that yes I do, and that is my point, that I have a bearing of what is important to you but you can't accommodate what is to me. And hey, when I don't accommodate what is more important to you and in case we run into a fight, you start thinking on the lines that I am fundamentally disgusted by you and am belittling your personality when all that we are doing is just arguing in a heated discussion about something sensitive.

6/3/19, 9:02 AM - Shona 😍: Tomorrow I'll have plenty of time
6/3/19, 9:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sexual energy? Any thoughts on that? 🤭

6/3/19, 5:37 PM - Shona 😍: You didn't show me yet
6/3/19, 5:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't make much progress
6/3/19, 5:37 PM - Shona 😍: Oh
6/3/19, 5:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤦🏻‍♂
6/3/19, 5:37 PM - Shona 😍: What did you work on?

6/3/19, 5:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The same data that I was working on Friday
6/3/19, 5:38 PM - Shona 😍: Well some kinda pic
6/3/19, 5:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ohmygod this one handed use is so nice.
6/3/19, 5:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have missed this
6/3/19, 5:38 PM - Shona 😍: Ah okay

6/3/19, 5:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I am planning to work from home
6/3/19, 5:40 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
6/3/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was your day darling?
6/3/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You still at the hospital?
6/3/19, 5:41 PM - Shona 😍: It was quite nice!
6/3/19, 5:41 PM - Shona 😍: At the bus stop
6/3/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay!
6/3/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So we are averaging each other out
6/3/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
6/3/19, 5:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Morally it was a tough one too. A lot of glamour at the workspace floor today🤐
6/3/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So a loooot of guilt
6/3/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: I had a really nice chat with my Estonian coworker. We sat in the kitchen for almost an hour because everything was already done but our shift hadn't ended yet. When I told her I had an Indian boyfriend almost the first thing she asked was how tall you are :D She thought that you must be really short but then she seemed to be pleased when she heard you're as tall as me. That reminds me how before we met I was almost certain you're way shorter than me, like up to my chin or something :P And how I was astounded when you were so tall too! And now I'm not sure if I have explicitly told you this before but that was one of the reasons why I pointed out before we met that I only want to be friends. The height issue I mean. Though I've had couple crushes on guys and even gone out with one that have been a bit shorter than me.
6/3/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: Ok not following exactly?
6/3/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Talked to Faizal about it
6/3/19, 5:43 PM - Shona 😍: Hehe
6/3/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He counselled me
6/3/19, 5:44 PM - Shona 😍: You mean the hot boss?
6/3/19, 5:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The part where you went out with someone and rejected them for height was unknown to me. Rest you told me yes. And I am glad you like my height. I would have worn heals thought 😌
6/3/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *though
6/3/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A lot other hot people
6/3/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: Hihi
6/3/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: No it was not because of his height. Hmm okay maybe unconsciously it was... I actually don't know why it was.
6/3/19, 5:48 PM - Shona 😍: I somehow almost feel bad for you. Like to me that sounds like a difficult way to live
6/3/19, 5:48 PM - Shona 😍: Like why you get so distracted or guilty about it
6/3/19, 6:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because those people are really really hot
6/3/19, 6:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd I am too good at writing sex stories🙄
6/3/19, 6:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like I want to tell you what that one person was wearing and how I feel about it and how it made me think of you and us but what can I say. I am not sure how you will take it
6/3/19, 6:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it's not my fault now that I am thinking about it. If I look hot and then I wear enticing clothes then I obviously will distract someone. Who can I blame. 😕
6/3/19, 6:15 PM - Shona 😍: No but the part that I don't quite understand that how can someone's hotness be so incredibly distracting. Like it just makes you think of sex? Or you just feel that you'd like to have sex with all of them? But that will never end since there are always gonna be more hot people and you wouldn't even have enough time for all the hot people. So I don't understand where do you think it will lead. What exactly do you feel when you see sexy people? Or is it just what you said that then you feel like telling me about it? But what about it would you want to tell me?
6/3/19, 6:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See. I will ignore your message beforr it influences me. So I will tell you directly what I think of. I want to be honest with you because it's you and I really love you and I really don't want to have it any other way but the true way with you. So give me sometime. I will directly tell you the whole thing.
6/3/19, 7:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I believe there is something that always ticks someone off. To me it's vanity. And then something related to that, that is beauty. I know it makes me go wow and I know I get infatuated very easily. I have been trying not to and that has been a challenge for years. I think that is why when I was settling with you for a partner I tried to assess the situation without weighing the factor as to how beautiful you are because then I would have always said a yes but having that factored out, I was able to make a responsible decision. But I think I am getting sidelined here. Although, now I am getting scared about typing it. Can we please talk about it directly on call? Conversations like these are better face to face.
6/3/19, 7:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And by years. I mean almost 8 years as far as I know. It takes a lot to talk about these things. I hope you understand. There is a lot of guilt that  is at play here. I seriously hope we tackle this properly without hurting each other.
6/3/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: We can talk about it on call.
6/3/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: I'm at Rautatieasema rn
6/3/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: I have to skip the dance class ☹
6/3/19, 7:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: WhyM
6/3/19, 7:05 PM - Shona 😍: I suddenly got horrible stomach ache and I don't know how long it'll last. On Friday I worked at a unit where people had stomach flu so I'm kinda afraid it's the same 🙄🙄🙄
6/3/19, 7:05 PM - Shona 😍: Let's see
6/3/19, 7:05 PM - Shona 😍: But at least I got the pics for the visa
6/3/19, 7:06 PM - Shona 😍: I'll reach Ylästö in about an hour
6/3/19, 7:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh baby
6/3/19, 7:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please no
6/3/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: 🙃
6/3/19, 7:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why the smile? 🙂
6/3/19, 7:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It did make me smile though 🙂
6/3/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: I also find this kinda amusing
6/3/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: If it's the same
6/3/19, 7:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Amusing?
6/3/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I'm weird :D
6/3/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: With Laura we laugh at such stuff
6/3/19, 7:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I can't point. I am not sobour either
6/3/19, 7:11 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe what's amusing about this in particular is because I was so damn careful on Friday. Washing my hands with soap, using the hand sanitizer and rubber gloves. I was c r a z y. So it's quite funny if I got it anyway
6/3/19, 7:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Makes me want to boast about my philosophy
6/3/19, 7:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The eat your marshmallow right away philosophy
6/3/19, 7:15 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
6/3/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The questions you have posed are very potent. They make me feel like I will fail you someday. I am very afraid. 😖 I know it's upto me but I just am so unsure of myself. It scares me. 😓
6/3/19, 7:30 PM - Shona 😍: I have trusted my heart with you. What I ask is that if the day comes when you don't want to be with me anymore you respect me enough to tell me that you want to break up with me instead of cheating.
6/3/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That day won't come. When I want to be with you. Maybe I am just a very very impatient man, so I will just do anything to come as close to you as quickly as possible and then I am sure I won't be worried. Its just that the distance is too much.
6/3/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *when I don't want to be with you
6/3/19, 7:33 PM - Shona 😍: glad you corrected that one. :P
6/3/19, 7:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂
6/3/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: The distance is very hard. Somehow I think it might be even harder after July. On the other hand I think it will be easier then after being together again. It's been a very long time not being with each other in person. Seriously. I really hope we can make the next time shorter. Even if we meet for a shorter while then
6/3/19, 7:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. I just hope I get a job very quickly somewhere in Europe
6/3/19, 7:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or anywhere at all for that matters
6/3/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
6/3/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The thing is that Macquarie has offices in London
6/3/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just hope I get a job there.
6/3/19, 7:46 PM - Shona 😍: That'd be amazing 🙂
6/3/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/3/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please reach home

6/3/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been there.
6/3/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Slowly as it gets tougher
6/3/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It becomes a chore
6/3/19, 8:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd then
6/3/19, 8:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It becomes tedious
6/3/19, 8:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then boring
6/3/19, 8:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is when you drop it
6/3/19, 8:19 PM - Shona 😍: Don't you know how to motivate someone 😂😂😂
6/3/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a pattern that I have observed
6/3/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's called problem solving
6/3/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: First asses the situation
6/3/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then find a solution around it
6/3/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: Ok well I haven't faced the problem yet
6/3/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: So did you wanna talk?

6/4/19, 12:40 PM - Shona 😍: ::D sorry i had to
6/4/19, 12:42 PM - Shona 😍: In that sense I think something more plain would work

6/5/19, 8:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You didn't sleep well?
6/5/19, 8:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would have liked talking to you
6/5/19, 8:38 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
6/5/19, 8:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not a fan of the idea?
6/5/19, 8:50 AM - Shona 😍: I wouldn't have minded otherwise but I was really tired last night and had the early wake up time today. And I'm sick, but apparently that's just an attitude problem so I'm not gonna say more about it to you
6/5/19, 8:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You really think it's an attitude problem or is that sarcasm?
6/5/19, 8:54 AM - Shona 😍: It was meant as sarcasm. On the other hand, I'm not sure how much is up to the attitude. But judging based on my past experience, when I feel like this I have always got sick. But who knows. Maybe this time it's different. Let's see.
6/5/19, 8:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have my views on the topic and that's what I said. However with that being said, I still love my babu and will always love her and will take care of her even if it's an attitude issue. Because I love her and she needs care.
6/5/19, 9:05 AM - Shona 😍: Okay. I'm having mixed feelings now. But I also realized I'm supposed to get my period soon so maybe I'm also pmsing. I don't know. Whatever
6/5/19, 9:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want to discount your feelings Shona. But how will you know me better if I don't tell you what I think. I also think that you should eat your marshmallow right away but I don't say that to you do I? I don't ask you to take snappy decisions. In fact I respected the STD thing when I was in Finland for what 3 months? But that being said I can still have my views right? Also, it's ok that you don't feel well, I am here for you, even if you are being unreasonable.
6/5/19, 9:22 AM - Shona 😍: Yes sure okay
6/5/19, 9:23 AM - Shona 😍: I love you
6/5/19, 9:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi

6/5/19, 10:44 PM - Shona 😍: That confuses me
6/5/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then let's talk about something else
6/5/19, 10:44 PM - Shona 😍: Why not try sharing this one
6/5/19, 10:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How sleepy r you?

6/5/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I may be mad at you if someday you don't tell me something
6/5/19, 10:52 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
6/5/19, 10:53 PM - Shona 😍: Well I kinda feel that by you telling me we could get closer, in some way or another, if you shared that. So it's a shame if you don't want to
6/5/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just realized I am getting angry
6/5/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe it's just an attitude problem
6/5/19, 10:54 PM - Shona 😍: Why?
6/5/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it is funny to be mindful of it and see yourself getting annoyed. I mean just to observe the Dragon unleash itself
6/5/19, 10:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe because I want to tell you what I thought of but I am concerned that you will get angry or maynot like it but I really want to tell you but I really can't but I want but .. you see the problem?
6/5/19, 10:57 PM - Shona 😍: Well you can't control my reaction. Even I can't. It will be what it is
6/5/19, 10:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then I will just get angry🤭
6/5/19, 10:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe it's an attitude problem 🤭🤪
6/5/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: I think it is an attitude problem
6/5/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: Omg dad had written the sweetest little story about Nelli 😭
6/5/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry for the change of topic
6/5/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh that! I wanted to share something similar
6/5/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: I just read it so I had to mention
6/5/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nana
6/5/19, 11:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go on
6/5/19, 11:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course darling
6/5/19, 11:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tell me more
6/5/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: How he had experienced having Nelli as a part of our family
6/5/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: In the beginning he didn't want us to get a dog
6/5/19, 11:04 PM - Shona 😍: He thought it's too much work and too big of a commitment
6/5/19, 11:04 PM - Shona 😍: Then he slowly changed his mind
6/5/19, 11:04 PM - Shona 😍: And prayed about it
6/5/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: And then one day he just told us
6/5/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: That he thinks we should get a dog
6/5/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: Us kids had wanted one for a long time
6/5/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Ane then he wrote about Nelli's sweet character
6/5/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: And how as he believes in heaven after this life and thinks we will meet Nelli there. Regardless of whether I believe the same or not, it made me cry
6/5/19, 11:09 PM - Shona 😍: Ok I'm getting super sleepy 😵
6/5/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is beautiful
6/5/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go sleep Shona.
6/5/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you.
6/5/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night

6/5/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I do
6/5/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I do
6/5/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: I still don't get that
6/5/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: Or haven't heard of that
6/5/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭
6/5/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok.
6/5/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: Orher than you telling about it
6/5/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: I will think of your heartbeat
6/5/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: And remember how it felt to rest my head on your chest and listen to it
6/5/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it will be soon. 🙂
6/5/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't worry
6/5/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go
6/5/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please sleep
6/5/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: 🙂
6/5/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: Hyvää yötä ❤
6/6/19, 7:36 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning rakas
6/6/19, 8:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning shona
6/6/19, 8:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How does your day look like?
6/6/19, 8:31 AM - Shona 😍: I don't have other commitments besides work
6/6/19, 8:31 AM - Shona 😍: I'm not gonna go to the Reggaeton class
6/6/19, 8:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😱😱
6/6/19, 8:31 AM - Shona 😍: And you of course
6/6/19, 8:31 AM - Shona 😍: 😁
6/6/19, 8:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😌
6/6/19, 8:33 AM - Shona 😍: What about you shona
6/6/19, 8:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have two commitments
6/6/19, 8:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The most important one is you
6/6/19, 8:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then work
6/6/19, 8:35 AM - Shona 😍: Ok I'm on the bus and I'm smiling like a fool
6/6/19, 8:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not a fool
6/6/19, 8:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *my* fool
6/6/19, 8:37 AM - Shona 😍: Does it bother you that I only thought of work when you asked? I somehow have these things in different categories in my head
6/6/19, 8:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No it doesn't
6/6/19, 8:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does it concern you?
6/6/19, 8:38 AM - Shona 😍: No
6/6/19, 8:39 AM - Shona 😍: But I'm gonna think about it
6/6/19, 8:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure.
6/6/19, 8:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I realized something with me
6/6/19, 8:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I never switch off my laptop
6/6/19, 8:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's a testament to the underlying behavior
6/6/19, 8:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I never really turn off the switch in my head
6/6/19, 8:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In which I stop thinking about work
6/6/19, 8:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just always am passively thinking about it
6/6/19, 8:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's not good.
6/6/19, 8:42 AM - Shona 😍: It's not
6/6/19, 8:43 AM - Shona 😍: Have you thought of ways how to switch it off?
6/6/19, 8:43 AM - Shona 😍: Like meditation?
6/6/19, 8:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I read about it in Deep work
6/6/19, 8:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's as simple as
6/6/19, 8:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Saying it to yourself
6/6/19, 8:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Literally that was the advice
6/6/19, 8:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That saying I am officially shutting down for the day out loud
6/6/19, 8:44 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah I remember your telling that or reading it somewhere
6/6/19, 8:44 AM - Shona 😍: Have you ever tried it before?
6/6/19, 8:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yesterday, I switched off my laptop, and also because I finished satisfactory work. And then it was soooo easy to not think about it. Knowing that I did good work and slept well.
6/6/19, 8:45 AM - Shona 😍: Ah! And that's such a great feeling
6/6/19, 8:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like saying more things that make you feel that
6/6/19, 8:47 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe you should try to tell yourself this then. Your work seems to be a lot about continuing some bigger project, so it might be more difficult to switch off if you don't concretely finish something in a day like you did yesterday.
6/6/19, 8:47 AM - Shona 😍: :)
6/6/19, 8:49 AM - Shona 😍: Or maybe you can think of different parts of the projects as concrete things
6/6/19, 8:49 AM - Shona 😍: Like finishing reading a section in the materials you study
6/6/19, 8:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the idea
6/6/19, 8:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I don't think it can be that concrete
6/6/19, 8:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe I will have to plan a hell lpt
6/6/19, 8:50 AM - Shona 😍: Planning might help, yes
6/6/19, 8:51 AM - Shona 😍: Wow the bus is turning into a sauna
6/6/19, 8:51 AM - Shona 😍: I'm wearing too much clothes
6/6/19, 8:52 AM - Shona 😍: Some people are wearing tank tops and shorts
6/6/19, 8:52 AM - Shona 😍: I have jeans and a coat 😂
6/6/19, 9:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A coat? You silly ass.😀
6/6/19, 9:11 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm well I'm just training
6/6/19, 9:11 AM - Shona 😍: Preparing for a lot of heat
6/6/19, 9:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wonder why
6/6/19, 12:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
6/6/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to say to that
6/6/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: I get it
6/6/19, 2:12 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe in some ways it's different for me since you've been in short distance relationships much more
6/6/19, 2:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have more information
6/6/19, 2:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I came in my underwear last night. Woke up late in the morning. Couldn't take a shower and now I smell. 🤭🤭🤭
6/6/19, 2:13 PM - Shona 😍: 😅😅😅😅😅
6/6/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am currently crapping. What are you up to?
6/6/19, 2:14 PM - Shona 😍: Eating 😂😂
6/6/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Input
6/6/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Output
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Shona 😍: Now I'm again smiling like an idiot trying not to laugh out loud
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Shona 😍: There's one other person in the room
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Shona 😍: Dead silent
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Smile at them
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Shona 😍: On her phone
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Freak them out
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Shona 😍: I did when I came in
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤪🤪🤪
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Shona 😍: This
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not the usual way. There is no fun in that
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Shona 😍: Not this :D
6/6/19, 2:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Creep her out
6/6/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Smile and confuse them
6/6/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Prank them
6/6/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄🤪
6/6/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok I am in a funny mood. 🤭😄
6/6/19, 2:16 PM - Shona 😍: I can tell
6/6/19, 2:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am guessing you are not a fan of these things when I say them
6/6/19, 2:18 PM - Shona 😍: To creep people out?
6/6/19, 2:18 PM - Shona 😍: I sometimes say such things myself
6/6/19, 2:18 PM - Shona 😍: This time actually doing it didn't seem appropriate
6/6/19, 2:20 PM - Shona 😍: Aaaaaaaah
6/6/19, 2:21 PM - Shona 😍: I can't wait to be there
6/6/19, 2:21 PM - Shona 😍: I get so excited from reading the blogs
6/6/19, 2:21 PM - Shona 😍: I've had a bit of a bad attitude before
6/6/19, 2:21 PM - Shona 😍: Hyi Hanna
6/6/19, 2:22 PM - Shona 😍: I really am looking forward to seeing your country
6/6/19, 2:23 PM - Shona 😍: In addition to being with you ofc
6/6/19, 2:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What kind of bad attitude do you mean?
6/6/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: How did I not get a notification for this message :O?
6/6/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry didn't mean to ignore it
6/6/19, 7:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Arrey you can tell me now
6/6/19, 7:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
6/6/19, 7:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No problem
6/6/19, 7:28 PM - Shona 😍: Well I think I was focusing on the negatives a lot. Like how I'm sure I'll get sick and how it's a lot of pollution there and I don't know anyone else there besides you. How getting the IUD will be painful af and why am I even getting it and what am I even doing going to visit my boyfriend what has happened to my values am I a bad person. What the fuck Hanna? It's not that I was only thinking along those lines but damn it I've been finding the negatives. Now I'm so, so excited. So what if I'll get a horrible stomach flu or dengue fever? I'll get healthy again. So what if there are a lot of pests? You can live there and 1.2 billion other people, so can I. I get to travel to a new and exotic country and meet and live with my love there for a month. I get to eat amazing food and see a different way of living that I'm used to. People dress and behave differently. Talk differently, move differently, eat differently, work differently... That's _fascinating_ . I have always loved traveling. What on earth had happened to me? This is like a dream come true! Many many different dreams come true. Wow. Hihi and also I get to buy such cute clothes. And getting the IUD will save so much trouble over several years, and it will not affect my hormonal balance that much.
6/6/19, 7:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have tears in my eyes.
6/6/19, 7:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought I was not exciting to you anymore
6/6/19, 7:30 PM - Shona 😍: Baby!!!!!!!!
6/6/19, 7:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought we had lost it as a couple
6/6/19, 7:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought I was a pain to you and that somehow I am toxic for you
6/6/19, 7:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I was thinking that maybe there is something wrong with me.
6/6/19, 7:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I still wanted you to come
6/6/19, 7:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I wanted to respect your feelings
6/6/19, 7:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I didn't like them but what could I have said.
6/6/19, 7:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't tell you how to feel
6/6/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: Ok I have no clue what to say now
6/6/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: Other than that I love you rakas
6/6/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not trying to force you by any means but please try to find words. I think we both can benefit from those.
6/6/19, 7:35 PM - Shona 😍: Well I just have more questions for you
6/6/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not sure what exactly are you referring to with those things
6/6/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: Why did you think you were a pain to me and toxic?
6/6/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: And which of my feelings are you referring to?
6/6/19, 7:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is she not happy with me
6/6/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That she thinks that coming to India is a waste
6/6/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that being said
6/6/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is she aware of it
6/6/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That she doesn't like me anymore
6/6/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you didn't feel good about coming to India
6/6/19, 7:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can talk about it on call
6/6/19, 7:50 PM - Shona 😍: Even with all the negativity I never thought it would be a waste
6/6/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm what I have been thinking is that maybe you don't really like me anymore
6/6/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why do you think that?
6/6/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And why didn't you say it?
6/6/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, if both of us are feeling that about each other then we really need to start taking more.
6/6/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: It's difficult to pinpoint it exactly. It was a general vibe
6/6/19, 7:53 PM - Shona 😍: That's true
6/6/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel it too
6/6/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just think its about the distance
6/6/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can feel it too
6/6/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is why I really am looking forward to that one month
6/6/19, 7:53 PM - Shona 😍: A major part of it yes
6/6/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will definitely define a lot of things for us
6/6/19, 7:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Who can we blame
6/6/19, 7:53 PM - Shona 😍: Exactly
6/6/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have even forgotten how you smell like
6/6/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to smell you
6/6/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't care about anything else
6/6/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: Same here!!!!!
6/6/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I want to smell you
6/6/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: I occasionally really try to remember, but it's almost impossible
6/6/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: Just a very vague memory of that
6/6/19, 7:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have stopped trying. It just makes me want to give up if I realize that I can't remember
6/6/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona I am really really really really looking forward to meeting you
6/6/19, 7:56 PM - Shona 😍: I can't even tell you how much I am too
6/6/19, 7:56 PM - Shona 😍: There simply are no words
6/6/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: And now I'm suddenly remembering more
6/6/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: More feelings
6/6/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Me too
6/6/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: When we were together here
6/6/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just remembered how we used to endlessly talk for hours
6/6/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And literally hours
6/6/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how it's so different from talking on video call
6/6/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You used to listen with your body
6/6/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: Yes! All those days in Espoo when Walid was somewhere else
6/6/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: And with him there too
6/6/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always talked to your non verbal cues
6/6/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how you used to respond with your body language
6/6/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how I miss that
6/6/19, 7:59 PM - Shona 😍: It's really hard on video call
6/6/19, 7:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How we used to cook
6/6/19, 7:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: being stared at by you while cooking
6/6/19, 7:59 PM - Shona 😍: Yes! You in your vest 😍 oh God that was so hot
6/6/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I remember I didn't know even care  about anyone else around me when I was with you
6/6/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And these days everytime I am out
6/6/19, 8:00 PM - Shona 😍: I wanted to come on to you but I had no idea how and I was also shy
6/6/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Its like my mind is on a hunt
6/6/19, 8:00 PM - Shona 😍: Yes!
6/6/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I have never battled with my instincts except for this relationship
6/6/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know how instinctively and impulsively I act
6/6/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am still not sure if you will do it now.
6/6/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm maybe it's about learning to do it. Somehow I felt I'm not allowed to do that
6/6/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: And allowed I don't mean morally
6/6/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know how I take a stand on your beloved. You are allowed to do everything. As long as you don't hurt the other person.
6/6/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: But just somehow I'm not supposed to
6/6/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can understand
6/6/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It can be scary
6/6/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or just an odd feeling
6/6/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am sure you now understand that that's not how it works
6/6/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah. But it will still be new to me to do it so it will feel... unusual at first
6/6/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I told you to watch some porn 😄😄
6/6/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now before you get offended
6/6/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: 😂
6/6/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want you to sincerely know
6/6/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That it was a _joke_
6/6/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: Shona I know
6/6/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: I did not
6/6/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Accha suno
6/6/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you
6/6/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Faizal just got into a relationship
6/6/19, 8:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He is very excited and wants to tell me about it
6/6/19, 8:08 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too rakas
6/6/19, 8:08 PM - Shona 😍: Wtf!!!??

6/8/19, 3:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The placebo is in play
6/8/19, 3:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So yeah I feel better

6/8/19, 4:04 PM - Shona 😍: Mitäh
6/8/19, 4:16 PM - Shona 😍: Shonu something bothers me a bit about the earlier conversation. I didn't mean to show off my money or something when I said I can get the phone for myself. I meant it in a way that of course you should gift your sister the phone, and not feel bad for not being able to gift me one too. Or I don't know if you were even feeling bad about it but I didn't want you to worry about it.
6/8/19, 4:52 PM - Shona 😍: I want a dog 😳
6/8/19, 4:52 PM - Shona 😍: No I don't
6/8/19, 4:52 PM - Shona 😍: I do

6/8/19, 4:54 PM - Shona 😍: No I don't want another
6/8/19, 4:54 PM - Shona 😍: Yet
6/8/19, 7:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Could it be that you want a dog with me?
6/8/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think it is horrible. She would have wanted for you to move on. She always wanted us to be happy
6/8/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will talk to you in a while
6/8/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/8/19, 9:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you mad at me?
6/8/19, 9:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I am having a terrific headache
6/8/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean the headache in itself is a very good headache so it is a terrific headache by headache standardd
6/8/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *standards
6/8/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But for me it is terrible
6/8/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: Not at all baby, why?
6/8/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: :(
6/8/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: Take some painkiller?
6/8/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have never hanged up on me
6/8/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: 😅
6/8/19, 9:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Naah. It will go away
6/8/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: What?? I thought we agreed we'll talk later?
6/8/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: The call quality was awful
6/8/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes we did. But I have never seen you get irritated with the call quality and hang up
6/8/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To you
6/8/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Even a very bad quality was fine
6/8/19, 9:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To you the person was more important
6/8/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At least thats what I thought
6/8/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: Well to me it seemed you were not very happy about the quality either
6/8/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I have always been impatient
6/8/19, 9:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I was having a headache as well
6/8/19, 9:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And ok. You are also sick
6/8/19, 9:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That explains it
6/8/19, 9:26 PM - Shona 😍: Did you feel bad about it?
6/8/19, 9:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I felt like somehow it's not you. The act of hanging up. So I was wondering if you are bored of me in general that you won't put up with all the pain of the bad call quality because you don't think it's worth it
6/8/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
6/8/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I am stretching it too far
6/8/19, 9:28 PM - Shona 😍: Baby! I'm sorry. I wasn't bored of you. I actually thought you were bored
6/8/19, 9:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The food was not good and it made me think that why on Earth am I living in this place
6/8/19, 9:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So a lot on my mind
6/8/19, 9:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And among other things there still are a lot of things on my mind.
6/8/19, 9:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am glad that I slept
6/8/19, 9:30 PM - Shona 😍: I understand
6/8/19, 9:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am also worried that I fucked up my sleep schedule
6/8/19, 9:30 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. Well it's only one day and one long nap
6/8/19, 9:31 PM - Shona 😍: On Monday you gotta get up early again
6/8/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Without a fail. Yes.
6/8/19, 9:31 PM - Shona 😍: That will kinda force you back on the schedule
6/8/19, 9:33 PM - Shona 😍: Do you want to talk about them more?
6/8/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just have to do them. I don't think there is much to talk about
6/8/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I should be working
6/8/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I feel like talking to you
6/8/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then I can't talk
6/8/19, 9:34 PM - Shona 😍: I could stare at you for hours. Just be quietly in your presence.
6/8/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I have work on my mind.
6/8/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah, I know you are creepy. My creepy. 😙
6/8/19, 9:36 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe it's better to do the work then? Or then start early tomorrow. Though you're probably gonna sleep late... Hmm.

6/8/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Preach to my girlfriend as to why she shouldnt have sex with me
6/8/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: ❤.
6/8/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Makes me remember how I was thinking sooo long term when I got into a relationship with you
6/8/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How I was in no hurry
6/8/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I remember how in espoo
6/8/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: when you used to study
6/8/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I felt like kissing your neck
6/8/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But i used to ask first
6/8/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I didnt want to distract youu
6/8/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Again, something that I never imagined I will do
6/8/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ask for permissions in such things
6/8/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are love
6/8/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: YOu are love
6/8/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are mine
6/8/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are just
6/8/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: love
6/8/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I want you to know
6/8/19, 9:49 PM - Shona 😍: That really made me feel comfortable and safe with you. That you asked and let me study and take it slow with everything
6/8/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I understand that you have been all your life a very very decent person. when we talk dirty these days. I really want you to know that you don't have to do anything that is beyond your comfort zone. If you don't feel like saying anything just don't say it. If you don't feel like doing anything from now until forever. Just let me know. Nothing is above what you want
6/8/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad that you feel safe with me. I think I have always wanted that with my lady, that she should feel safe with me. Always! And I am glad that you felt safe with me. I wish you could make you feel safer.
6/8/19, 9:54 PM - Shona 😍: I have been doing that lately. Only saying the things I actually feel at the moment. Doing the things we talk about will of course be different and maybe not all of it can be done or maybe some wouldn't feel good actually doing it. But we will try things and see what works and what we enjoy together
6/8/19, 9:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know, there were times in these 6 months when I could have acted upon these unkind thoughts of mine for my own pleasure. Really, it is such an easy logic to give  yourself. I will do it because I want it. But every time any such thought occurred there was also this remembrance how much I care for you. and how I can't hurt you and take your life by betraying you. You have trusted me with your heart. and that to me will always be the most prized possession. Remember you said how you have trusted me with your body? I just feel that it was soooo sooooo soooo romantic. It is the most simple yet the most beautiful thing anyone has ever said to me.
6/8/19, 10:04 PM - Shona 😍: I do remember saying that and I really meant it. I felt that when you were here, and then after that as I've got to know you better in these months when we have been talking. That I can trust you with everything in and about me.
6/8/19, 10:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can go back to the post that I wrote for Nelli. Read it again and you will know that what we have is the same. When you say you trust me with your body and heart, you have put me in charge. You have given up yourself completely and you have trusted me with it, now do I have it within me to kill that thing? To look you in the eye and cheat on you? To decide an end date for our friendship and until that day look you in the eye, hiding what I have in my heart?
Do I have it in me to take a life? Do I have it in me to kill what I was trusted with? 
I am not comparing you to a dog. I am comparing the closeness of our bond to that what you had with Nelli. That day, that last day, I was in tears, because this realization hit me, what do I have it within me to slain what is not mine? Is it really how I want to live my life? It was a very very very very deep philosophical debate that I had with myself and then I cried after that and I slept. And I was ever so close to Nelli. Even in her last moments, she helped me be a better man.
6/8/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad that I was finally able to put it in words and say it to you. I am glad that God blessed me with this ability to convey what i feel to the only pair of ears with whom I would want to share all this. I am glad that he blessed me with you.
6/8/19, 10:09 PM - Shona 😍: That's very well put and a good comparison. And indeed it is a tough debate
6/8/19, 10:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it can be a very very beautiful story
6/8/19, 10:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wow it's a terrific headache
6/8/19, 10:11 PM - Shona 😍: Shona please take some painkiller? Or massage your head and neck in the tensed parts, that might help
6/8/19, 10:12 PM - Shona 😍: I wish I could do that to you
6/8/19, 10:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking about the same
6/8/19, 10:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like sleeping more.

6/9/19, 7:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or my habits in general
6/9/19, 7:44 PM - Shona 😍: Yes!
6/9/19, 7:44 PM - Shona 😍: But isn't it good to think about it sometimes at least
6/9/19, 7:45 PM - Shona 😍: Made me feel somewhat uncomfortable with myself
6/9/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is the problem
6/9/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't like tgat
6/9/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *that
6/9/19, 7:46 PM - Shona 😍: But isn't that healthy sometimes
6/9/19, 7:47 PM - Shona 😍: Or am I just a hopeless masochist (not  in the sexual sense)
6/9/19, 7:47 PM - Shona 😍: That I kinda like it
6/9/19, 7:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think it is.

6/9/19, 7:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We all need to take life a little lightly

6/9/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is.
6/9/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: And I've been thinking about it since last December
6/9/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like getting my ear piercing
6/9/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please get them
6/9/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you will like it
6/9/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There used to be a series of ads when I was little
6/9/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It used to say
6/9/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That
6/9/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A change is refreshing
6/9/19, 9:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really feel that it is really really true
6/9/19, 9:36 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah...
6/9/19, 9:36 PM - Shona 😍: But not with everything

6/9/19, 9:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/9/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: That will I just want this color back soon

6/9/19, 9:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes ma'am
6/9/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: Hihi
6/9/19, 9:39 PM - Shona 😍: One ear? Or both?
6/9/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One
6/9/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you mind?
6/9/19, 9:40 PM - Shona 😍: Shona
6/9/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: If you really want to
6/9/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: Go ahead
6/9/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: You've been thinking about it for a long time too
6/9/19, 9:41 PM - Shona 😍: And if you end up not liking it you can just take it off
6/9/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yea
6/9/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Are you still working?
6/9/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well it is a little bit left
6/9/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I want to talk

6/9/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The world cup is going on
6/9/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Ahaha
6/9/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Way too many distractions
6/9/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Poor you
6/9/19, 9:44 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
6/9/19, 9:45 PM - Shona 😍: How much?
6/9/19, 9:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Half an hour at max
6/9/19, 9:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know the data now.
6/9/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can actually manage funds now 😄
6/9/19, 9:46 PM - Shona 😍: That's not much
6/9/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hedge funds and all

6/9/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: In your head?
6/9/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: Or on the computer?
6/9/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
6/9/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: Btw I can't get over that Nelli pic 😍
6/9/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: I just want to put my forehead on hers
6/9/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
6/9/19, 9:49 PM - Shona 😍: 🤯👍🏻
6/9/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This pic is completely for you
6/9/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is one of those philosophies of mine.
6/9/19, 9:49 PM - Shona 😍: ❤❤❤❤❤
6/9/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That who do you dress up for
6/9/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For yourself
6/9/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or for your beloved
6/9/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will always dress for my beloved
6/9/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For you
6/9/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I will only see myself once
6/9/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When I am dressing up
6/9/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you will see me
6/9/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Through out the day
6/9/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmmmmmmm
6/9/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is why I will always prefer what you prefer
6/9/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if that means wearing anything
6/9/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or putting on anything
6/9/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just want to do it with you
6/9/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *for
6/9/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will never see my pic
6/9/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: This is a very interesting matter
6/9/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you will see it all the time
6/9/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: The dressing up
6/9/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's why
6/9/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's what you like
6/9/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: Other people will see it too
6/9/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And they can go fuck themselves
6/9/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't care about then
6/9/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *them
6/9/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Only you matter
6/9/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: And I feel dressing up can also be a way of expressing yourself
6/9/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing else does
6/9/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure. Then, that expression is that I love my girl and everything in my life is about her.
6/9/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/9/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was that too much 😄
6/9/19, 10:21 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to think about that
6/9/19, 10:22 PM - Shona 😍: I mean it is an exaggeration again
6/9/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wow
6/9/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't expect that
6/9/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well believe what you want
6/9/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's what I think
6/9/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: Baby
6/9/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: But isn't it a hyperbole
6/9/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: Äh
6/9/19, 10:25 PM - Shona 😍: I don't mean to offend you
6/9/19, 10:27 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if there's any point in debating about this again
6/9/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is nothing to debate about darling
6/9/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's just a preference
6/9/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yes
6/9/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it is a hyperbole
6/9/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I want to have it
6/9/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does it bother you if I dress for you?
6/9/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I believe in selfless love.
6/9/19, 10:32 PM - Shona 😍: No
6/9/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I think dressing up for you is a part of it
6/9/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And sure.
6/9/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If bikinis are a bit much
6/9/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But if you choose a shirt for me
6/9/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then that can be my new favorite
6/9/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am pissing you off
6/9/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I certainly don't like it
6/9/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And can you please then say that what does
6/9/19, 10:35 PM - Shona 😍: You are not
6/9/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did it go from this
6/9/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To this
6/9/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To this
6/9/19, 10:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can use more words to help me understand.
6/9/19, 10:38 PM - Shona 😍: Well to some extent, dressing up for your partner is nice. But I don't think either one will be happy if it's always about what the other one wants for you instead of what you want yourself. I think it's the same as with the food preferences example
6/9/19, 10:38 PM - Shona 😍: And seriously I'm not pissed at all
6/9/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you think you will always point At what I should wear? No. Because I believe I am quite tasteful as well. So in some rare occasions that you will, I want to prepare myself mentally that your choice will prevail.
6/9/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I am.
6/9/19, 10:40 PM - Shona 😍: And that sounds completely fine to me.
6/9/19, 10:40 PM - Shona 😍: Can you then start saying that you're pissed instead of saying that I'm pissed
6/9/19, 10:41 PM - Shona 😍: It's not the first time you do this
6/9/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Until now
6/9/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't realized I do this
6/9/19, 10:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I will from next time
6/9/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
6/9/19, 10:42 PM - Shona 😍: It's fine
6/9/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The reason why I am pissed is
6/9/19, 10:42 PM - Shona 😍: Are you pissed because of this? Or just stressed from the work?
6/9/19, 10:42 PM - Shona 😍: ?
6/9/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I feel it is something you will like
6/9/19, 10:43 PM - Shona 😍: And?
6/9/19, 10:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you didn't
6/9/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: It is a sweet idea. Maybe I just focused on the wrong part again.
6/9/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: You like to use hyberboles
6/9/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: I tend to take things literally
6/9/19, 10:56 PM - Shona 😍: I am sorry
6/9/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Shona please don't hate me
6/9/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: I can be very unromantic at times
6/9/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: And just a reminder not related to this, did you take the meds?
6/9/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not hating
6/9/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just was bummed
6/9/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
6/9/19, 11:22 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry
6/9/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to be sorry
6/9/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm okay
6/9/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: I am getting sleepy
6/9/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: Did you finish the work?
6/9/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No.
6/9/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night shona

6/9/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd now it's in cracks 😤
6/9/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂
6/9/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: 😖😖😖😖😖
6/9/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now I am just wondering
6/9/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I should ask the guy to get it repaired
6/9/19, 11:35 PM - Shona 😍: :/
6/9/19, 11:35 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah well it was his fault
6/9/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. The day started off well
6/9/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I don't know what to feel about it
6/9/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
6/9/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want to spoil his high
6/9/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The dynamics can be decided later.
6/9/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah that sounds good
6/9/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: 🙂
6/9/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: It can be a good day then
6/9/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: Despite the more unfortunate events
6/9/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: Shona

6/10/19, 7:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
6/10/19, 8:05 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning kulta
6/10/19, 8:43 AM - Shona 😍: Oh God......... There's a horrible article in our main newspaper about how women are treated poorly in India. It goes on and on about how violence and sexual abuse are still common in marriages and whatnot. I almost feel like cencoring it from the paper before my parents read it, I'm afraid they're gonna lose their shit. Or then they just get really worried. And/or give me some kind of a lecture. Yes it is important that these kind of topics are discussed too in our papers, but sometimes it feels like it's only the negatives that are talked about and people get a very one-sided view on such things, or even of an entire country. 🙄
6/10/19, 8:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😃
6/10/19, 8:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want to speak on call?
6/10/19, 8:44 AM - Shona 😍: Sure?
6/10/19, 8:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean about this?
6/10/19, 8:46 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah I'd like to but we can do it later too if you need to work
6/10/19, 8:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes please
6/10/19, 8:47 AM - Shona 😍: Ok
6/10/19, 8:47 AM - Shona 😍: Puccha

6/10/19, 8:59 AM - Shona 😍: 😚😚
6/10/19, 9:05 AM - Shona 😍: Seriously I feel like keeping the paper to myself and pretending it never arrived
6/10/19, 9:06 AM - Shona 😍: I'm so gonna get a lecture
6/10/19, 11:13 AM - Shona 😍: Shona. I found something interesting while googling, before my exam. It was after the last time you watched porn, and I thought I just need to educate myself more about it. It is a book about porn and today I finally bought it and started reading it. From the beginning you've made a case against yourself and been selfless in many ways. You wanted me to have all the information and make my choices about you and us based on that, not just trying to convince me to be with you. That's love. And as I found out about the book, I think it's a similar case. Kind of a case against me and my beliefs. I recognize my beliefs may have and may still be biased and based on irrational and selfish wants. I know porn has been a part of your life for such a long time, and that sex is very important to you. So I would want you to have all the information that you can get on the topic, even if it's against what I currently believe or feel. And then make your decisions based on that. And I think it's beneficial for me to read it, I believe it will give me some fresh perspectives and topics for us to discuss. I think I'm gonna read it myself anyway, even if you don't want to yourself. I love you.

6/10/19, 8:45 PM - Shona 😍: She obviously doesn't give a shit about me
6/10/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh?
6/10/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She thinks the same
6/10/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: she finds you really sweet
6/10/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: she totally respects you
6/10/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: cares about you
6/10/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: is staying away for your sake
6/10/19, 8:45 PM - Shona 😍: She knew you were in a relationship with me, and still she said you two should be together? What kind of a woman does that to another woman?

6/10/19, 8:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just giving you another perspective
6/10/19, 8:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She is a nobody to me
6/10/19, 8:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Obviously you matter the most

6/10/19, 9:00 PM - Shona 😍: I don't care if she didn't know me in the beginning, that's not what you do to another human

6/10/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd you tend to get pleased quickly on call
6/10/19, 9:02 PM - Shona 😍: I don't want you to make me smile!
6/10/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I want to try when my odds are higher
6/10/19, 9:02 PM - Shona 😍: I want to discuss the t o p i c
6/10/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know baby. But isn't calming you down a good thing before starting a discussion.

6/10/19, 10:45 PM - Shona 😍: Mostly they were just worried about me going around the city by myself
6/10/19, 10:46 PM - Shona 😍: Basically they believe I will be raped and killed and whatnot if I go by myself
6/10/19, 10:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hope I will be able to keep you safe
6/10/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean not that you need my protection
6/10/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But Just in general how I can caution you better
6/10/19, 10:53 PM - Shona 😍: We'll figure it out
6/10/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: Shona did you take the meds?
6/10/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: But seriously wow. I've been so busy all my life thinking I will be the most likely victim of violence since I'm a woman, and never thought I could lay a hand on someone myself. I thought it's obvious I wouldn't do that but somehow today I could see a scenario where that could happen in theory and I'm astounded and disgusted
6/10/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not yet.
6/10/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will do after dinner
6/10/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry that you feel that way but I'm glad that I was able to give you a new perspective in life.
6/10/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
6/10/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: Me too
6/10/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know where I would be without you Kunj Behari Beriwala
6/10/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: I would be very much lost
6/10/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I dedicate a song?
6/10/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: Please
6/10/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/kS5KMsUl1NI
6/10/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen to it please
6/10/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On your headphones

6/10/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Together?
6/10/19, 11:52 PM - Shona 😍: Where did I find you?
6/10/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: You wonderful man
6/10/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: I want you to come home to me each day too
6/10/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In a book of faces I guess. Where you had your pretty one and I had my honest one. You saw through my eyes and I fell for yours. ♥
6/10/19, 11:58 PM - Shona 😍: ❤
6/10/19, 11:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Again, please don't be mad that I called your face just pretty. There is more to it. And please allow me to explain
6/10/19, 11:58 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not mad
6/11/19, 12:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When I first saw  your photo. I thought it's that of a lady's. Like a 28 year old at least. And believe me, that made me get attracted to you even more. I couldn't believe my eyes, I was like omg that person, she is soooo, mysterious, you somehow felt confused, a bit lost, but wise, mature,  innocent, I can't ever forget that picture. What you also felt like you were searching for someone but then you didn't find it so you settled for yourself and made peace with it. I think I was attracted to the mystery all the more. And God can I say, you still are a mystery to me. One that I love to love each day. Every second. Every instant.
6/11/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: You are very good at reading people
6/11/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: Babu

6/11/19, 6:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
6/11/19, 6:18 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
6/11/19, 6:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I dreamt of a very doable and a very good research idea
6/11/19, 6:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In psychology
6/11/19, 6:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In perception
6/11/19, 6:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I found the solution to a problem that I was looking for days
6/11/19, 6:46 AM - Shona 😍: Awesome! Do I get to hear more about them?
6/11/19, 6:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why else would I mention Mera shona
6/11/19, 6:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So my hypothesis is that people who own phones are better at locating an object as opposed to others
6/11/19, 6:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Who don't
6/11/19, 6:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I was struggling with a divide by zero error for days from work
6/11/19, 6:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was computing a ratio that for individual rows
6/11/19, 6:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't know what to do with the error
6/11/19, 6:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I realized I can just directly sum the rows
6/11/19, 6:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd Then compute the ratio
6/11/19, 6:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will still be a better stat than anything else
6/11/19, 6:54 AM - Shona 😍: Why? They get good training when looking for their lost phones?
6/11/19, 6:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. In general they have to locate their phones all the time in scenic environment so that trains them at locating a discreet object regardless of the surrounding
6/11/19, 6:56 AM - Shona 😍: Hey that's great!
6/11/19, 6:56 AM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmmm
6/11/19, 6:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slept very peacefully
6/11/19, 6:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thanks to our conversation
6/11/19, 6:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Last night

6/11/19, 6:57 AM - Shona 😍: Still bothered by it
6/11/19, 6:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Poor Hanna
6/11/19, 6:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh no.
6/11/19, 6:58 AM - Shona 😍: Haven't been able to sleep since 2.30
6/11/19, 6:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wtf?!
6/11/19, 6:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why didn't you call me?
6/11/19, 6:58 AM - Shona 😍: It's not only the conversation
6/11/19, 6:58 AM - Shona 😍: Or maybe it is
6/11/19, 6:58 AM - Shona 😍: I dunno
6/11/19, 6:59 AM - Shona 😍: You needed to sleep too
6/11/19, 6:59 AM - Shona 😍: And honestly it didn't even cross my mind to do that
6/11/19, 6:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
6/11/19, 6:59 AM - Shona 😍: I tried to sleep more
6/11/19, 7:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please can we talk?
6/11/19, 7:00 AM - Shona 😍: Sure

6/11/19, 9:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you more than I could have imagined
6/11/19, 9:34 AM - Shona 😍: 🧡.
6/11/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was so wet. Thanks to your distractions in the morning.
6/11/19, 11:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey dear,
You will probably see this message in the morning and I wish you a very very good morning. Have a great great day ahead. I wish all the very best. 
But wishes remind me of something else and that reminds me of blessing. Blessings in my mythology and in my personal life are of the utmost power and potency. But for death I guess these blessings if given with a kind heart can negate the furthest of the unfortunates. That being said, the most potent blessing in my life that I have seen do wonders is that of my parents, even my father, who was careless enough to leave was careful enough to bless me in his last letter. 


That being said, this message is not about a blessing that I seek but a blessing that you have already blessed your daughter with and that is of a healthy long life and that too oozing with happiness and dear Annikka I believe in the blessing that has thus been given and I choose to believe that beyond anything, it will safe guard your daughter from all evil. 

Hanna, told me about the newspaper article and ma'am I am well and truly ashamed of what it entailed but unfortunately that's a part of reality we live in. Inhumane behavior such as that stems from a very deep carnal self that poverty breeds. Being at the bottom of the social pyramid and perishing at the hands of a corrupt government, a capitalistic economy and an overpopulated nation doesn't help. That being said the horrors being committed are totally unjustified and unimaginable. Yet they are real and I am so sorry that Hanna is headed to right where the article talked about. 
But, Annikka please trust me that your daughter is my life to me. If not for you guys, I would have pompously said that I love her the most in the world. But that being said, I understand that you guys love her and care about her and how her trip to India is a nightmare for you, especially after what you have heard but dear I assure you and I promise you that we will be careful in our ways and cautious in our endeavors and your daughter will be completely safe with me. I commit to her safety and I thereby guarantee you that no one will be able to harm your daughter. 
I don't mean to be a superhero but I do intend to be a responsible friend and I felt like being a citizen of this nation for so long and being a brother to a sister in the same nation, I can ensure that you feel that your daughter is safe.
This message has been long, I hope it serves its purpose. I will really appreciate if you call me back to discuss this further and how I will go about doing what I promised.

Anywho, I wish you a great day ahead. 

All the best Annikka.
6/11/19, 11:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning dear Tuisku!
Thank you for your kind words and understanding our point of view. I was just amazed once  again the timing how God lead that article to be published  right now Hanna being headed for India in A few weeks.   Ofcourse I felt bad and very sorry first of all  for you Indian citizens but secondly I started to think of Hanna walking there in New Delhi all of her own and that terrified me A little bit.Trusting in Jesus in all of your ways doesnt mean being careless or not using your own understanding and brains. 
to be continued later...need to go.
Blessings for your day!
Annikka
6/11/19, 1:37 PM - Shona 😍: !!
6/11/19, 1:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Words?
6/11/19, 2:28 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry I didn't have the time earlier 😬
6/11/19, 2:41 PM - Shona 😍: Your message... I'm sure mum feels at least a bit better after that. I mean how could she not? I know you're good with words but wow... I'm interested in hearing what more she has to say about it. I think they worry too much but I guess it's understandable.
6/11/19, 3:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona can I please say something?
6/11/19, 5:00 PM - Shona 😍: Please
6/11/19, 5:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please say more 😄
6/11/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: Well it was really moving and to me it sounds very chivalrous what you said about guaranteeing to keep me safe
6/11/19, 5:56 PM - Shona 😍: Also that reminded me of something earlier. So there are these certain smells or scents that seriously turn me on. I have no idea what it's about. One dude at the office where I clean used to wear some amazing cologne or something and I could smell it like day after he's been in the room. Wow do I sound like a creep 😂😂😂 I've seen the guy and he's not attractive to me at all and actually he seems a bit of a jerk. But that cologne of his.... Omg. And it was before I ever met him when I realized what that scent does to me. I remembered this again today because one of the patients had a very different but also a very sexy cologne and again I was really turned on. Okay this dude was also attractive physically. But the point is that some scents make me really horny 😄
6/11/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey shona
6/11/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is your health
6/11/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How are you?
6/11/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What are you upto?
6/11/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: Napping 😬
6/11/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: But how did I miss my alarm 😱😱😱
6/11/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: It was 10mins ago
6/11/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmmm
6/11/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: I'm fiiiiiiin3
6/11/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: Are you at the apartment?
6/11/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Naaaah

6/11/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Back to the same place
6/11/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To eat 😄
6/11/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A question. What did you have to wake up for?
6/11/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: Oh! That's so nice 😃
6/11/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: Nothing much, just to make sure I don't sleep too much at this time so that I can sleep again around my normal bedtime
6/11/19, 8:08 PM - Shona 😍: Turns out it was on vibrate only 😬
6/11/19, 8:08 PM - Shona 😍: How's he? And how's his new relationship?
6/11/19, 9:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh
6/11/19, 9:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Too little too soon too say. He says he is in love and that he is very close. I am not judging him but only time will tell.
6/11/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: I see
6/11/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No you can't
6/11/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't show
6/11/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I saw
6/11/19, 9:49 PM - Shona 😍: 🙃
6/11/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In the morning
6/11/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And God was I wet
6/11/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: Hihi
6/11/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was your day baby?
6/11/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been talking to Annikka
6/11/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: It was pretty good
6/11/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: I was surprised I felt so okay despite the horrible sleep last night
6/11/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah she told
6/11/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: Also, someone really creeped me out at work
6/11/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How so?
6/11/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Checking you out?
6/11/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: I'd rather tell on call
6/11/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will reach home in about 50 mins
6/11/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a loooong ride home.
6/11/19, 9:54 PM - Shona 😍: No, that I'm used to and it's usually not creepy :D
6/11/19, 9:54 PM - Shona 😍: Uuuuuuh
6/11/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So how is it like for you and how often do people check you out and why did  I never notice any?
6/11/19, 9:56 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know. But at work I've noticed several times some cute nurses checking me out. One was so obvious, I seriously caught him staring at me several times
6/11/19, 9:56 PM - Shona 😍: I don't notice it on the streets either, if that happens
6/11/19, 9:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nurses as in females? I am sorry, I am not familiar with the usage of the word for males.(if applicable)
6/11/19, 9:58 PM - Shona 😍: Hihi nope
6/11/19, 9:59 PM - Shona 😍: Male nurses
6/11/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh
6/11/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why didn't you go talk to them?
6/11/19, 9:59 PM - Shona 😍: I do talk to them
6/11/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: Like I talk to the other staff members
6/11/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: We need to communicate :D
6/11/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What do you think it's about?
6/11/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A crush?
6/11/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or gossip?
6/11/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If it's a crush you should seriously consider talking to them
6/11/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And hear me out as to why you should do that
6/11/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I think it is healthy for your ego
6/11/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And makes it easy for them to get over your crush
6/11/19, 10:01 PM - Shona 😍: Why
6/11/19, 10:03 PM - Shona 😍: I only saw that obvious dude once. So I don't think it's a crush. I think he was just quite casually checking me out
6/11/19, 10:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A little praise, I guess is always very healthy for you. When was the last time someone other than me and that one guy on the bus stop actually praised you. Or told you how awesome you are. Like they really meant it? I feel that it is a very healthy exercise that all of us should do.
6/11/19, 10:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hormones I tell you 🤣
6/11/19, 10:04 PM - Shona 😍: At one point I got annoyed when I had caught him several times I thought like don't you have work to do or something 😂😂
6/11/19, 10:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really like it when that office friend tells me how I am the best person on Earth or for that matter when anyone does
6/11/19, 10:04 PM - Shona 😍: I can imagine
6/11/19, 10:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But why annoyed Shona. 😕
6/11/19, 10:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *😄
6/11/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: I think I was hangry at that point actually. After I had eaten I found it flattering again :D
6/11/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
6/11/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Self aware Hanna
6/11/19, 10:06 PM - Shona 😍: He was very hot himself
6/11/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/11/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it legible?
6/11/19, 10:08 PM - Shona 😍: Not really
6/11/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Leave it. I will show you later
6/11/19, 10:08 PM - Shona 😍: Okay

[6/11, 11:53 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: Never mind. Next question.
[6/11, 11:53 AM] +20 106 622 2432: I didnt talk to her a lot, but seems not so open minded
[6/11, 11:53 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: What do you think she will think about when you will help others
[6/11, 11:53 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are a very very helping man
[6/11, 11:53 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: How does she feel about that
[6/11, 11:53 AM] +20 106 622 2432: Of cours she will love it
[6/11, 11:54 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: You think that or she said that
[6/11, 11:54 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: Her getting impressed is a different thing. Her getting involved is another
[6/11, 11:54 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's say we had Salik come over like at our place. Will she be have fine with it?
[6/11, 11:54 AM] +20 106 622 2432: That's true,
[6/11, 11:55 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: *will she have been fine with it?
[6/11, 11:55 AM] +20 106 622 2432: Yes i think, we didnt talk a lot, we talked for few hours only
[6/11, 11:55 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does she like cleanliness?
[6/11, 11:55 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something to think about then
[6/11, 11:56 AM] +20 106 622 2432: Yes
[6/11, 11:56 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry, wrong question. Obviously, all of us like cleanliness. What I mean to ask is, that does she clean like you and me?
[6/11, 11:56 AM] +20 106 622 2432: Yes she is so clean
[6/11, 11:56 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's so good.
[6/11, 11:57 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: Last question
[6/11, 11:57 AM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does she love food? Is she the kind of person who enjoys her meals?
[6/11, 11:57 AM] +20 106 622 2432: But hey, I see your questions are more about personality and you didnt comment about how she looks like, why?
[6/11, 12:01 PM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't get me wrong. I don't think I can comment about her looks based on two pictures. Obviously she seems beautiful. The pictures are not that good, so can't really say but looks are also more about personality as in the body language. If a person looks very beautiful in pictures but stoops while walking then I don't think they actually look nice. They are just pretty. I don't know how she is in person, maybe if I was to see her on video call then I can say but other than that, I really don't want to be judgemental. And the reason why I am asking these personality based questions is because those are the first things that came to my mind and those are the things that are the most important aspects of your personality that she has to be comfortable with, something that you may have missed.
[6/11, 12:02 PM] Kunj Behari Beriwala: I remember you telling me about such important questions when I first came to see the apartment. 🙂
[6/11, 12:04 PM] +20 106 622 2432: That's the answer what i needed to hear from you, you are so clever man..cause most of people are talking direct about how girl looks like, and actually personality is the most important like you said..well said..👍🏻
6/11/19, 10:09 PM - Shona 😍: Who is it about?
6/11/19, 10:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The girl Walid is thinking of marrying

6/11/19, 10:58 PM - Shona 😍: Bring it on Beriwala!
6/12/19, 7:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
6/12/19, 7:34 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning shona
6/12/19, 8:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was wondering
6/12/19, 8:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That what do you think about me now
6/12/19, 8:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In terms of the "intense" person that you thought I was in the beginning
6/12/19, 8:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does that still remain?
6/12/19, 8:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What about it has changed?
6/12/19, 8:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I can recall that many people have said to me that I look intense in the first meet
6/12/19, 8:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I think that's just one side of me and yeah if they see me in that kind of a scenario then you _will_ think that I am intense but I have had multiple other kinds of first impression as well.
6/12/19, 8:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I was just curious that if that was my impression to you then what is it like now?
6/12/19, 8:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I actually am hoping you will write a character sketch but having known you from the past, I will take anything you throw at me 😄
6/12/19, 8:29 AM - Shona 😍: 😄
6/12/19, 8:29 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm lemme think
6/12/19, 8:55 AM - Shona 😍: So I got the intense impression from the beginning. At first it was because you seemed to text so often. But maybe it just seemed a lot to me because I was pretty much at the other end of the spectrum intense-wise :D  It was just strange to me. And to me it was also weird that you wanted to discuss such personal things at first, like saying that I can talk about the workplace dude with you. That seemed like too much too soon. On the other hand somehow I've really liked people when they just cut the crap and go straight to the point, like such deeper and more personal conversations. So in a way I liked that from the beginning. And I don't think you've changed much in regards to that during this time, but my own attitude towards it has changed. I think you've been intense all the while but now I'm just used to it and I like it even more. And I think intense alone is not enough to describe it, partially because it has more negative associations. It's also you caring about the other person enough to want to know and connect with them on a more meaningful level. Not everyone you meet is up for that, but I think the ones that are, really like it. I actually don't know if you always do that with new people or how do you decide in what way you direct the conversation. Or if it even is a conscious decision or do you just make the choices intuitively.
6/12/19, 9:03 AM - Shona 😍: That was just scratching the surface of all this
6/12/19, 9:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I liked the scratching I must say ♥
6/12/19, 12:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Missing me?
6/12/19, 12:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can tell that I am missing you
6/12/19, 12:54 PM - Shona 😍: BABY
6/12/19, 12:54 PM - Shona 😍: I was just thinking about you
6/12/19, 12:54 PM - Shona 😍: I love you
6/12/19, 1:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂🤭
6/12/19, 4:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/12/19, 4:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I wànt to come back home
6/12/19, 4:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Curl up in your lap
6/12/19, 4:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And cry
6/12/19, 4:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I want to have that only with you
6/12/19, 4:49 PM - Shona 😍: Rakas!
6/12/19, 4:49 PM - Shona 😍: What happened?

6/12/19, 5:33 PM - Shona 😍: I'm free shonu when you want to talk
6/12/19, 5:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was just wondering that 40 mins got over 4 mins ago😌
6/12/19, 5:35 PM - Shona 😍: I had to change 😬
6/12/19, 5:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Aren't you supposed to show me these things?

6/12/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: Oh god
6/12/19, 7:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you using the Headphones?
6/12/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: I used to like this when I was a lot younger
6/12/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't realize it's soooo dirty
6/12/19, 7:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😕
6/12/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: I just came across it again
6/12/19, 7:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I seriously don't like these songs
6/12/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙄
6/12/19, 7:23 PM - Shona 😍: Nope, the earphones
6/12/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/_6ZTfmb9YU4

6/12/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The reverence of his beloved
6/12/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am telling you
6/12/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Only if you were to know Hindi
6/12/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: People who once listen to Urdu poetry
6/12/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They can't go back to anything
6/12/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Urdu and Hindi are spoken the same
6/12/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Written differently
6/12/19, 7:31 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmm
6/12/19, 7:33 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't go to Jumbo after all. I realized I might need to transfer money to a different account since I don't know of I have enough on the other. And I didn't know if I had enough charge in the phone for that. And I'm hungry. And I've been walking all day I didn't want to walk sooooo much more. Mgh.
6/12/19, 7:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi

6/12/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: I remembered us living here
6/12/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: Napping together in the evening

6/12/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both are good
6/12/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course this is crazy cheap
6/12/19, 8:12 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
6/12/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok wait
6/12/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wow
6/12/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What an ass
6/12/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's what you were talking about
6/12/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am doing this.
6/12/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There are a few things that I have to say
6/12/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See
6/12/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The phones are on sale because of an ongoing sale.
6/12/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that is that
6/12/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And baby I am doing  everything in my power to make that happen. I crave for it each day. I may not have said it but it was partly the reason why I was so depressed in February because I couldn't see a way how we can make that happen
6/12/19, 8:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But now I am more hopeful
6/12/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I believe I can make it happen
6/12/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I promise
6/12/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I promise it will be like heaven baby
6/12/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Each day will be like the most peaceful
6/12/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the most fulfilling
6/12/19, 8:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mind you, not happy but fulfilling
6/12/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There will be sad days as well
6/12/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it will be worth it
6/12/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry shona
6/12/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I got distracted
6/12/19, 8:31 PM - Shona 😍: Hihi I'm glad you realized that on your own
6/12/19, 8:32 PM - Shona 😍: And I understand the phones now
6/12/19, 8:33 PM - Shona 😍: And maybe I'm just starting to understand that now. How it could possibly have felt for you back then. I don't know how was I not like that myself back then
6/12/19, 8:34 PM - Shona 😍: ❤.
6/12/19, 8:36 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow in the past few days I've had very vivid memories from our time together when you were here
6/12/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: And it was quite a realization I had yesterday. I told you but I'm not sure if you really understood. When I said I don't think it's possible for you to make me uncomfortable anymore. And that means I feel more free with you. If I feel uncomfortable it's because it feels like I can't express something or be a certain way. Now it feels like I can freely express it, that I can also feel angry or annoyed or hurt and show it too.
6/12/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ...
6/12/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously don't know what to say
6/12/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
6/12/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Going to say it one by one
6/12/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: First things first, I am glad
6/12/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Second I am honored
6/12/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Third I feel like crying
6/12/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fourth I seriously feel my vocabulary is so limited or it's just that I am feeling really pressured here.
6/12/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad because I make you feel that way
6/12/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you would trust me with that
6/12/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Glad that you finally have someone like that in your life
6/12/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Glad that we can be closer now
6/12/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Crying because look what we did Shona. Together. 🥺🥺🥺♥
Just look at what we made. Think of it as an object. Can you imagine it? There is no form to it. It can be anything you imagine. But somehow whatever it is, whatever it may be, I feel it is just too beautiful.
6/12/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I can write poems for you in Hindi but how come not so in English
6/12/19, 9:08 PM - Shona 😍: Wow! I never thought about it that way
6/12/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: But you struggling with words also tells a lot. Because that happens very rarely
6/12/19, 9:09 PM - Shona 😍: You have written also in English Shona
6/12/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just feel the metaphors are very different
6/12/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very very different
6/12/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And they are much more beautiful in Hindi
6/12/19, 9:10 PM - Shona 😍: I understand.
6/12/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will translate my status for you
6/12/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They suspect me for my intentions as to what I want you for,
Neither happened the reunion not even the love, nor. 
You ask me why I have come to you now,
But tell me how to tell you why a boat needs a oar.
6/12/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is the closest I could get to a rhyme
6/12/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hope it makes sense
6/12/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It still is a translation
6/12/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not the exact match
6/12/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it doesn't have to be.
6/12/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it's not for you
6/12/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a general poem
6/12/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For a lover's agony
6/12/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't worry, it's not for any ex, I just keep writing these, have been writing for a very long time, it's the feelings that I have from the broken me.
6/12/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *heart-broken
6/12/19, 9:19 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow I really like it
6/12/19, 9:19 PM - Shona 😍: It moves me
6/12/19, 9:20 PM - Shona 😍: In a way I can't quite describe
6/12/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You say you can't say,
But that doesn't take the quest away,
I wish u could tell you what to say
But oh my love what the wind can is propel,
But never guide the way.
6/12/19, 9:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *I could tell you
6/12/19, 9:37 PM - Shona 😍: Makes me feel melancholic and hopeful at the same time
6/12/19, 9:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss your long messages
6/12/19, 9:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thats how they made me feel
6/12/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sukriti's mom just posted a status about an art exhibition she is about to hold. Of her paintings. My God! That's really inspiring. I am afraid that it will not be appreciated as much, I mean the whole family operates on an over inflated self fuelling overtly positive feedback mechanism that makes them live in their own bubble but makes me go wow. That in this age she is doing something like that in a city like Kanpur. It really is something. Or it might just be a very narcissistic step out of the bubble that the family lives in but I am trying not to be judgemental and take it in positive light and draw inspiration from that
6/12/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: Ohhoh
6/12/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please make a decision
6/12/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you do
6/12/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The sale is only on for the next two days
6/12/19, 10:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And please complete the sentence what you are about to say
6/12/19, 10:02 PM - Shona 😍: I don't really know the family at all, except for what little you've told me, so I can't say much about that. But what she is doing is quite impressive
6/12/19, 10:02 PM - Shona 😍: What?
6/12/19, 10:02 PM - Shona 😍: Oh
6/12/19, 10:02 PM - Shona 😍: That
6/12/19, 10:03 PM - Shona 😍: But it's not any cheaper than on Amazon?
6/12/19, 10:03 PM - Shona 😍: This
6/12/19, 10:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good choice smart move.
6/12/19, 10:03 PM - Shona 😍: ?
6/12/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah it's the same price everywhere
6/12/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it will be the same everywhere
6/12/19, 10:07 PM - Shona 😍: What I mean is that the sale doesn't matter then?
6/12/19, 10:07 PM - Shona 😍: So I don't need to decide yet
6/12/19, 10:07 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
6/12/19, 10:07 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
6/12/19, 10:07 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
6/12/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
6/12/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I agree
6/12/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I don't mean to rush you
6/12/19, 10:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's what I do
6/12/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I should not
6/12/19, 10:08 PM - Shona 😍: PUCCHA
6/12/19, 10:08 PM - Shona 😍: BIG BIG PUCCHA
6/12/19, 10:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Accha ji
6/12/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Accha is ok
6/12/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ji is a suffix to add more respect
6/12/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Accha ji correctly translates to
6/12/19, 10:18 PM - Shona 😍: That I know kulta
6/12/19, 10:18 PM - Shona 😍: That I didn't remember
6/12/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: ?
6/12/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well that's not the exact translation
6/12/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But in my heart
6/12/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It means
6/12/19, 10:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok ma'am
6/12/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: 😄😊😚
6/12/19, 10:38 PM - Shona 😍: I will write you again.
6/12/19, 10:38 PM - Shona 😍: Kulti
6/12/19, 10:39 PM - Shona 😍: Did you take your meds already?
6/12/19, 10:40 PM - Shona 😍: My goodness I'm sleepy
6/12/19, 10:40 PM - Shona 😍: Also did you get food?
6/12/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No I will now
6/12/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. We did.
6/12/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: Yay
6/12/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: Baby
6/12/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: I get it
6/12/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: So difficult to find words
6/12/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night shona
6/12/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: In another language
6/12/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: But I wrote something
6/12/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I thought you slept
6/12/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please say
6/12/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: It's not a poem
6/12/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what it is
6/12/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: Love letter maybe
6/12/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: In you I found

A partner
With you I want to build a team so strong 
that no tremble can break it apart. 

A friend
With you I trust my everything, and I ask that with me you trust yours. 
I will care for it with all that I have. 

A lover
I want to lose myself in you, 
unlock the deepest passions and pleasures
waiting to be found 
in these earthly bodies. 

A mother
Your care for me is beyond measure. Your selfless love and your confidence in me remain after mine has faded long ago. 

A father
Your protection and good will for my life make me feel safe. I'm not scared of any challenge when you encourage me.

A child
I want to care for you. I want to be the shoulder for you to cry on. I want to be the lap that you sit on, seeking for comfort. I will kiss your tears away and hug you so tight and long that you feel nothing can hurt you anymore. 
I want to make you strong. 
You are my most precious. 

An angel
My guardian, but also that of others. You help everyone to find their way safely home, to their loved ones, to where they can find peace. 

An image of God
Born of the holy, like all the children of God. In and through you, I have seen another glimpse of the eternal Love of God.
6/12/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: I will sleep now
6/12/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: I almost am already
6/12/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: It will pass otherwise
6/12/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: Baby
6/12/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: I love you
6/12/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: Good night
6/13/19, 7:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
6/13/19, 7:31 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
6/13/19, 7:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am guessing you slept well
6/13/19, 7:53 AM - Shona 😍: Like a log
6/13/19, 8:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I guessed
6/13/19, 8:33 AM - Shona 😍: How did you sleep shona?
6/13/19, 8:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very nice. A bit less but nice.
6/13/19, 8:35 AM - Shona 😍: 😊
6/13/19, 8:45 AM - Shona 😍: You didn't like this?
6/13/19, 8:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/13/19, 8:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Words
6/13/19, 8:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wait
6/13/19, 8:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't find them
6/13/19, 8:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have read it like a thousand times
6/13/19, 8:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I got high last night and I have so many things to tell you
6/13/19, 8:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry I have been busy
6/13/19, 8:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will reply to that in earnest
6/13/19, 8:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As far as your question goes. I was awestruck
6/13/19, 8:49 AM - Shona 😍: Ok take your time 😄
6/13/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How does your day look like?
6/13/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: My shift ends at 3 as usual
6/13/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: Not sure if I'm gonna go to the Reggaeton class
6/13/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: Quite likely not
6/13/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: So I dunno about the evening yet
6/13/19, 1:02 PM - Shona 😍: I should probably start packing too 😄
6/13/19, 1:02 PM - Shona 😍: But it includes talking to you I hope
6/13/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂
6/13/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I got my screen repaired
6/13/19, 2:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I haven't done a single second of work until now
6/13/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: Yay 🎉
6/13/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: Oh? How come
6/13/19, 2:48 PM - Shona 😍: Hehe
6/13/19, 2:48 PM - Shona 😍: Turns out I have very very little work in the afternoon
6/13/19, 2:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The project didn't get an approval
6/13/19, 2:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So kind of bummed about it
6/13/19, 2:49 PM - Shona 😍: Oh!!!!!! 😱
6/13/19, 2:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They are giving me a shitty job. And I really really don't like it
6/13/19, 2:49 PM - Shona 😍: You mean rn?
6/13/19, 2:49 PM - Shona 😍: Something new?
6/13/19, 2:49 PM - Shona 😍: That sucks!!
6/13/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. They are asking me to do the Taxonomy bit
6/13/19, 2:50 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaa
6/13/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I can't talk to any expert
6/13/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd they expect me to google
6/13/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Assume
6/13/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Write my assumptions
6/13/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd make a taxonomy
6/13/19, 2:50 PM - Shona 😍: But what's the point if it didn't get approved? They still gonna use it?
6/13/19, 2:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Which "may" be used in the future
6/13/19, 2:51 PM - Shona 😍: 😒😒😒
6/13/19, 2:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May with a big if
6/13/19, 2:51 PM - Shona 😍: I see
6/13/19, 2:51 PM - Shona 😍: Ugh
6/13/19, 5:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
6/13/19, 5:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Call?
6/13/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why did I say that when I am not home
6/13/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙄
6/13/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You should leave me. Seriously, I am the worst
6/13/19, 5:40 PM - Shona 😍: Shona it's fine
6/13/19, 5:40 PM - Shona 😍: And
6/13/19, 5:40 PM - Shona 😍: Shut up
6/13/19, 5:41 PM - Shona 😍: Did something else happen? Other than the project not getting approved of?
6/13/19, 5:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
6/13/19, 5:46 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
6/13/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/13/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you think I am worthless?
6/13/19, 6:05 PM - Shona 😍: Darling! How can you even ask such a question? Did you already forget what I wrote about you last night? Would I write that about someone I think is worthless? You mean everything to me.
 And if you are thinking that in the context of the internship, you sure as heck aren't worthless. They already literally told you you are doing best work of the interns. It sucks that the project is off but I'm sure there is some reason for you to be still working on the taxonomy. Even if it seems meaningless at this moment.
6/13/19, 6:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just don't want to do some work that has no meaning
6/13/19, 6:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hate doing futile labor
6/13/19, 6:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously
6/13/19, 6:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just fucking hate it
6/13/19, 6:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At the same time
6/13/19, 6:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like I should just lock myself in a room and finish the whole fucking thing in 2 days
6/13/19, 6:13 PM - Shona 😍: I understand. But could it be that they want to see something else when they give you such a task? To see how you handle something like that? I get it that futile labor feels so frustrating. If/after I get to med school, I have almost no use for the physics and chemistry I studied for two years. So in a way that was futile labor. On the other hand I think I can apply that knowledge or at least the kind of thinking or problem solving in something else in life. It did teach me new skills in the end. So I don't think what you're doing is a waste at all. And why would the company want to waste their resources and money for something useless, when a skilled person is doing something meaningless? So I don't think it is.
6/13/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are right. It will teach me a lot. A lot! And rather than sulking I should take it as a challenge
6/13/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just don't trust his authority
6/13/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He may as well be  trying to blow the dust off his shoulder
6/13/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: By assigning me a job
6/13/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He was like
6/13/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Keep doing it
6/13/19, 6:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sure we can find some use for it
6/13/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or keep doing it
6/13/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One day we will find a use for it
6/13/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or keep doing it
6/13/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can't help you much
6/13/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But do what you can
6/13/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wtf?!
6/13/19, 6:17 PM - Shona 😍: :/
6/13/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I gave my everything to the project
6/13/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand that he didn't get the approval
6/13/19, 6:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But treating me like an unwanted addition that he doesn't have a job for and in turn provides me a petty job
6/13/19, 6:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's like giving a demented child a toy to play with and ask him/her to sit in the corner with it
6/13/19, 6:23 PM - Shona 😍: I don't believe it is like that but I understand it can feel that way.
6/13/19, 6:28 PM - Shona 😍: Or, maybe I'm wrong, maybe it is like what you say. But in that case they are such inconceivable fools that I don't even know what to say
6/13/19, 7:40 PM - Shona 😍: Baby
6/13/19, 7:41 PM - Shona 😍: Are you fine?
6/13/19, 7:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeag
6/13/19, 7:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *yeah
6/13/19, 7:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I went to play
6/13/19, 7:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Feeling much better now.
6/13/19, 7:41 PM - Shona 😍: 😍🤩
6/13/19, 7:41 PM - Shona 😍: I'm so glad
6/13/19, 8:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Call?
6/13/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I called Amazon
6/13/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For some customer assistance
6/13/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Some girl picked up
6/13/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd before hanging up

6/13/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
6/13/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: Haha
6/13/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love to prank people like this
6/13/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄😄😄😄
6/13/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean she had a nice voice
6/13/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I feel very sly
6/13/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When I am able to do these things
6/13/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like some naughty child
6/13/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Teasing others
6/13/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Blowing in other's ears
6/13/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tickling the world
6/13/19, 8:32 PM - Shona 😍: 🙃😃
6/13/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
6/13/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I was thinking
6/13/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How my face will be wet
6/13/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When you ride it
6/13/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will smell like your cum
6/13/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And will be slimy with my spit
6/13/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I will rub that on your tits
6/13/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But before doing that
6/13/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will
6/13/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Push my nose and my tongue in your cunt
6/13/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Deep in
6/13/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I will shake my face
6/13/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Side to side
6/13/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With my tongue out
6/13/19, 9:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And my lower teeth
6/13/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Showing
6/13/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just a little bit
6/13/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How will you feel
6/13/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The softness of the tongue
6/13/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On your soft cunt
6/13/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The push of the nose

6/13/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Between your legs
6/13/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would also like to massage your boobs
6/13/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With my both hands
6/13/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: While doing all that
6/13/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So they don't feel lonely
6/13/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May be I will put three fingers in your mouth
6/13/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To make them wet
6/13/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd then use the same to massage you
6/13/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And your white titties
6/13/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe I will use one hand
6/13/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For the boobs
6/13/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To pinch them
6/13/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And do you know where the other will go?
6/13/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With its pinkie
6/13/19, 9:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somewhere around your asshole

6/13/19, 9:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In your cunt
6/13/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will pull my hair

6/13/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why aren't you touching yourself?
6/13/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You seem disinterested
6/13/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You could have asked me to stop
6/13/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's ok you can eat
6/13/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's just disappointing that I haven't seen you come even once
6/13/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seeing you disinterested doesn't help with this.
6/13/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What else are you doing on your phone anyway?
6/13/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙄
6/13/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes please
6/13/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I will sleep
6/13/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am very very sleepy
6/13/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I'm sorry
6/13/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
6/13/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
6/13/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I did not
6/13/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah
6/13/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I will
6/13/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah
6/13/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Feeling lazy
6/13/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, a bit grumpy
6/13/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to plead
6/13/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will take them and sleep. You can go if you want to
6/13/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
6/13/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bye
6/13/19, 9:13 PM - Shona 😍: Good night
6/13/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry if I am being a. Jerk
6/13/19, 9:27 PM - Shona 😍: Nah
6/13/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: Are you up?
6/13/19, 10:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yup
6/13/19, 10:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hehehe that rhymed
6/13/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why do you ask baby
6/13/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was sleepy
6/13/19, 10:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it passed
6/13/19, 10:13 PM - Shona 😍: I've been seriously horny today
6/13/19, 10:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
6/13/19, 10:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh so now you are interested?
6/13/19, 10:14 PM - Shona 😍: And I realized I would've rather been on the mood to see something, not read
6/13/19, 10:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are just
6/13/19, 10:14 PM - Shona 😍: Though maybe I was too hangry even for that
6/13/19, 10:14 PM - Shona 😍: Also
6/13/19, 10:14 PM - Shona 😍: Today I feel like fucking myself in the ass with the dildo
6/13/19, 10:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it supposed to mean something that I just masturbated to that
6/13/19, 10:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not even kidding
6/13/19, 10:16 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds like you like the idea
6/13/19, 10:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah
6/13/19, 10:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Especially with my dick in your cunt
6/13/19, 10:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the diildo in the back
6/13/19, 10:17 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
6/13/19, 10:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just bought some weed for Neeraj. He has been begging me for two days now.
6/13/19, 10:18 PM - Shona 😍: 😅
6/13/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: Are you gonna smoke it with him?
6/13/19, 10:19 PM - Shona 😍: Or did he just want to get some?
6/13/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think so
6/13/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe not just that.
6/13/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona now I am totally yours
6/13/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can make any demands that you want
6/13/19, 10:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You want to see me? Read? Anything
6/13/19, 10:28 PM - Shona 😍: I just want the dildo in my ass
6/13/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish I could spit on your asshole
6/13/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then shove my dick in it
6/13/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The dildo is such a disappointment
6/13/19, 10:29 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah that'd be better
6/13/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh god Hanna Katariina Kolehmainen
6/13/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to fuck all your goles
6/13/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *holes
6/13/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All of em
6/13/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't wait to lick your asshole
6/13/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And kiss it
6/13/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And bite you there, just a very very very teeny tiny bit
6/13/19, 10:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like a pinch but very light
6/13/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like flicking your clit
6/13/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With my
6/13/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Dick
6/13/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then massaging your cunt
6/13/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On the outer side
6/13/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With my dick
6/13/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then glancing your hole with it
6/13/19, 10:31 PM - Shona 😍: Can I see it?
6/13/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What can you show me for it?
6/13/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry. It was supposed to be hot
6/13/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't mean to upset you
6/13/19, 10:33 PM - Shona 😍: It didn't!
6/13/19, 10:33 PM - Shona 😍: I was thinking what kinda pic to send
6/13/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to send a pic
6/13/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just play along on video call
6/13/19, 10:33 PM - Shona 😍: It's difficult on call
6/13/19, 10:34 PM - Shona 😍: Everyone's still up
6/13/19, 10:34 PM - Shona 😍: Mum in the next room
6/13/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok then you enjoy
6/13/19, 10:34 PM - Shona 😍: I can't focus
6/13/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will enjoy some other day
6/13/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You want pics?
6/13/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or video?
6/13/19, 10:34 PM - Shona 😍: Both
6/13/19, 10:36 PM - Shona 😍: Oh god
6/13/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: I can show you something separately if you want. But at the same time on call it's too difficult
6/13/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure. But first concentrate on yourself
6/13/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And be demanding
6/13/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you think you want me to do something
6/13/19, 10:38 PM - Shona 😍: I really liked this
6/13/19, 10:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just let me know
6/13/19, 10:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can also say more rough or less rough in any particular video
6/13/19, 10:41 PM - Shona 😍: Oh yes
6/13/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want to watch me masturbate?
6/13/19, 10:42 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
6/13/19, 10:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can close your video
6/13/19, 10:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will mute my call
6/13/19, 10:43 PM - Shona 😍: 👌🏻
6/13/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: I like it
6/13/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: But it's taking a while for my asshole to relax
6/13/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: Can you lean back?
6/13/19, 10:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry. I didn't read that
6/13/19, 10:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did that do anything for you
6/13/19, 11:04 PM - Shona 😍: It's ok
6/13/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
6/13/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: Well that took forever
6/13/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: Interesting
6/13/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: I guess you slept
6/13/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: Good night rakas
6/14/19, 7:12 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning baby
6/14/19, 7:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning darling
6/14/19, 8:21 AM - Shona 😍: https://youtu.be/rSPYEbDhAhM
6/14/19, 8:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did you sleep baby?
6/14/19, 8:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will look at it kater
6/14/19, 8:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *later
6/14/19, 8:25 AM - Shona 😍: Really well again 😊
6/14/19, 8:25 AM - Shona 😍: What about you?
6/14/19, 8:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Kept waking up in the middle
6/14/19, 8:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But sleep is refreshing
6/14/19, 8:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because work is stressing
6/14/19, 8:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May be  I am digressing
6/14/19, 8:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it's just a ****ing
6/14/19, 8:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can't think of a word that rhymes
6/14/19, 8:26 AM - Shona 😍: :D
6/14/19, 8:26 AM - Shona 😍: :/
6/14/19, 8:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Amit gave some very good advice
6/14/19, 8:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He was like
6/14/19, 8:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seperate work from personal life
6/14/19, 8:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And to me it made sense
6/14/19, 8:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also
6/14/19, 8:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking about the feedback again
6/14/19, 8:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What they said about talking to seniors
6/14/19, 8:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So there are a few things that I thought
6/14/19, 8:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: First I was able to crack down the chain of whispers
6/14/19, 8:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So Rooma i wished
6/14/19, 8:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Said to varun
6/14/19, 8:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because he is my manager
6/14/19, 8:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And Varun in turn
6/14/19, 8:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Said to Ajay
6/14/19, 8:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because he must have asked
6/14/19, 8:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it's not like the entire floor knows
6/14/19, 8:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that exaggeration is out of the window
6/14/19, 8:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I thought that
6/14/19, 8:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe they just said it casually
6/14/19, 8:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like when asked about me
6/14/19, 8:31 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah I think that's kind of common advice that I've heard people say. Like having time in the day that you just don't think of work. I think it's the same thing as was in deep work. Telling yourself that you're done for the day
6/14/19, 8:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They said
6/14/19, 8:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or they must have said
6/14/19, 8:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or I choose to believe that that is how they would have said it
6/14/19, 8:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That
6/14/19, 8:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah he is nice and all
6/14/19, 8:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But these are a few things
6/14/19, 8:32 AM - Shona 😍: Aah. So you thought it's a really big thing that everyone knows about it
6/14/19, 8:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I was thinking why would anyone say like that
6/14/19, 8:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
6/14/19, 8:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I realized yeah its a bit much for the divisional head who is the head of  half a floor if she gets wished by every employee
6/14/19, 8:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Openness doesn't have anything to do with a lady's plight of doing a thousand good morning I am good how was your day conversations
6/14/19, 8:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So yeah, empathy
6/14/19, 8:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One other thing,
6/14/19, 8:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I realized
6/14/19, 8:35 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
6/14/19, 8:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That just because these people in the Gurugram office are a little conservative+reserved+stringent
6/14/19, 8:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It doesn't have to be that the entire organization is like that
6/14/19, 8:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is labelling
6/14/19, 8:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So another cognitive distortion
6/14/19, 8:36 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah
6/14/19, 8:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is exactly what Ajay Bhaiyya my HR brother did.
6/14/19, 8:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When asked why is it so important the feedback
6/14/19, 8:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He just said with a coy smile
6/14/19, 8:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's corporate
6/14/19, 8:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe that's how corporate works
6/14/19, 8:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But this is no example to stereotype such a big community
6/14/19, 8:38 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe not
6/14/19, 8:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, maybe she(Rooma) just said that he wishes me a lot to Varun(my manager) very very casually and he just was cautioning me very casually and I over inflated it in my head
6/14/19, 8:42 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah I think it's most likely to be like that. It's easy to exaggerate it in our heads, focusing on the negative
6/14/19, 8:44 AM - Shona 😍: And now you also know how the people in that office feel about such things
6/14/19, 8:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it the expert in you talking
6/14/19, 8:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The negative seeing expert 🤭
6/14/19, 8:45 AM - Shona 😍: I've been very good at exaggeration and focusing on the negative
6/14/19, 8:47 AM - Shona 😍: 😎
6/14/19, 10:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was yesterday any good for you?
6/14/19, 11:33 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah... But I think I was trying to focus on too many things at once. I probably should've tried something like that first on my own
6/14/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I am taking too many meds
6/14/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I finally realized how the melatonin is too much.
6/14/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Whenever I take it
6/14/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel drowsy the whole next day
6/14/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's not good
6/14/19, 11:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I yawn more than usual
6/14/19, 11:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I don't see others yawning
6/14/19, 1:25 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmm. Is it the 10mg one?
6/14/19, 1:25 PM - Shona 😍: Because of the tiredness?
6/14/19, 1:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I take half
6/14/19, 1:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I feel even that is a bit much
6/14/19, 1:31 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah well the strongest ones they sell here are 1.9mg and that's what I take 🤔
6/14/19, 1:31 PM - Shona 😍: I don't feel drowsy the next day
6/14/19, 1:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bring some for me
6/14/19, 2:37 PM - Shona 😍: Do you not have the ones with the smaller doses there? I can bring you some but I think they're costlier here  😬
6/14/19, 3:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes maybe so. I am just being lazy🥴
6/14/19, 3:16 PM - Shona 😍: This is a sad place. On Wednesday one patient got home, and today he came back. I didn't know what's the thing with him until today when I overheard the nurses talk about him. Apparently he beats his wife pretty badly, and I don't know how many times this has happened that he goes home and comes back. I saw the wife on Wednesday and her eye was really badly bruised. The first thing I thought was that maybe the man beats him but then I told myself to not be so negative. Maybe she's been to an accident or something. Turns out I was right. The nurses were wondering too that how many times does this need to happen until the doctors decide some other kinda care for him. :/
6/14/19, 3:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will never get how people get that energy to do that. Please kill me baby. The day I do that.
6/14/19, 3:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I took an hour long nap 🧐
6/14/19, 3:35 PM - Shona 😍: At work??
6/14/19, 3:42 PM - Shona 😍: At what time are you leaving to Kanpur?
6/14/19, 3:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 9 pm
6/14/19, 3:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yup
6/14/19, 5:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am done for the eay
6/14/19, 5:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *day
6/14/19, 5:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I will do some work for Amit he needs some help with the website
6/14/19, 5:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But other than that
6/14/19, 5:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am totally free
6/14/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is very very hot today
6/14/19, 5:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 44
6/14/19, 5:08 PM - Shona 😍: Yay!
6/14/19, 5:08 PM - Shona 😍: 🎉
6/14/19, 5:08 PM - Shona 😍: Huhhuh

6/14/19, 7:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slept for two more hours
6/14/19, 7:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😱😱
6/14/19, 7:53 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaaaaaa
6/14/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: That's a lot of napping
6/14/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: But hey probably it's good since you're traveling in the night time and won't get as much sleep 😴
6/14/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: But seriously whaaaat
6/14/19, 7:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know. It should be the other way
6/14/19, 7:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sleep being carried over to travelling nights
6/14/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm maybe
6/14/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: Oh well
6/14/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: It already happened

6/14/19, 8:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I forgot to reply to it
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You could have messaged
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometimes I forget
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can remind me in that case
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have no idea.
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe playing in the evening
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Increases my body temperature
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I can't sleep well
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then the melatonin
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Doesn't help
6/14/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I was sleepy at 10 last night
6/14/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And even then I couldn't sleep
6/14/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I just missed it by a few minutes
6/14/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: First I got horny
6/14/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then I had to get some for Neeraj
6/14/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *weed
6/14/19, 8:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I slept at 12 again
6/14/19, 8:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So the carry over sleep+ body temperature+ melatonin
6/14/19, 8:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't think of any other reason
6/14/19, 8:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it's also because I was mentally relaxed maybe
6/14/19, 8:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because Di got her phone and I booked my ticket and all and everything was almost done
6/14/19, 9:12 PM - Shona 😍: Hihi I slept too. Just woke up

6/14/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 1000 Rs down the drain
6/14/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe if they wait for me then I won't
6/14/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But i don't think it will happen
6/14/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: 😱😱😱

6/14/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it's not the same as in English
6/14/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bitch is somehow a very negative word to you
6/14/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And even to me
6/14/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it's more like a sloppy way of calling someone coy or sly

6/16/19, 1:55 PM - Shona 😍: What are you working on? The taxonomy?

6/16/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: Is your sister helping?
6/16/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
6/16/19, 2:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Surprisingly she has turned into a very likable version of herself
6/16/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: Well that's lovely
6/16/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: #tbt
6/16/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To be thought
6/16/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does level of discomfort caused bear any proportionality with dissonance present?
6/16/19, 2:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: #tbt
6/16/19, 2:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also,
6/16/19, 2:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How does liking of food change with the wait time due to the increasing hunger? Is that a direct proportionality or an inverted parabola? It will be interesting to look at the confounds for this one.
6/16/19, 2:26 PM - Shona 😍: Hey that is an interesting question!
6/16/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: Every day that I'm not with you seems like a waste
6/16/19, 4:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sitting in my own templr
6/16/19, 4:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *temple
6/16/19, 4:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am laughing while reading it
6/16/19, 4:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄

6/16/19, 6:02 PM - Shona 😍: I will download this when I have wifi
6/16/19, 6:02 PM - Shona 😍: I can't see it yet
6/16/19, 6:09 PM - Shona 😍: #tbt you were right when you said some time in thr spring that I'm the least motivated person studying for med school exam... I had a hard time believing it myself when I've been saying I want to be a doctor. I'm reading the book Nudge now. It makes me more and more interested in psychology and human behavior. So again I'm thinking about studies in theology and studying psychology as a minor. As opposed to 12 years in med school.
6/16/19, 8:58 PM - Shona 😍: Shona
6/16/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/16/19, 8:59 PM - Shona 😍: How are you?

6/16/19, 8:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The bigger question is

6/16/19, 9:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will go back in the morning
6/16/19, 9:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Arrey say na
6/16/19, 9:00 PM - Shona 😍: Oh???

6/16/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: Tall pretty and blonde

6/17/19, 12:31 AM - Shona 😍: Whateva
6/17/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My day was very exhausting
6/17/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very very exhausting
6/17/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But very interesting
6/17/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So much public
6/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So many people
6/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So suffocating
6/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But so worth it
6/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean the goosebumps and all
6/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The feels
6/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The scenes
6/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking about you the whole time
6/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And a very important match was on
6/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So very taken up
6/17/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But this was a constant theme
6/17/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: It's been really nice actually! No arguing at all and it's been a lot of fun! We took the boat from Helsinki to Tallinn and then drove here, we're close to Latvia's capital. We reached around 4. We set everything up with the camper and then took a nap with Laura. Then we cooked dinner, some nice vegetarian pasta. It's such a nice camping site! So peaceful and lot of nature around
6/17/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I couldn't help but wonder what you will think of those streets and those roads and those places and will you even like them? Worship with me in those places? I just couldn't stop thinking about it
6/17/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that takes away another of my worries ♥♥
6/17/19, 12:36 AM - Shona 😍: What did you actually do there at the temple? For the whole day?
6/17/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will tell you later
6/17/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to go now
6/17/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to get up in 5 hours
6/17/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And Mausi is getting pissed that I am using my phone
6/17/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry.
6/17/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I said that I am not busy
6/17/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I want to talk
6/17/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
6/17/19, 12:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have got to get my head straight
6/17/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: Good night then
6/17/19, 12:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I also have to work tomorrow
6/17/19, 12:38 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah
6/17/19, 1:29 AM - Shona 😍: I get it, you had a busy day and so did I. You have work tomorrow. I just hope we can talk sometime soon. It's been ages since we talked properly and I feel quite distant. I have been thinking about you and us a lot today. I have remembered many things from the time when you were here and I can't wait to create so many new memories with you in July. At the same time I feel desperate because it's only for a month, and I don't know when can we be together again after that. But then I feel hopeful and trusting too that we will find a way. And it will be heck of a lot easier to plan further when I get my results from the exam. 16 days left rakas. I love you. Good night and good morning to you. I wish you a bright day ahead 💛

6/17/19, 6:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And this
6/17/19, 6:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/17/19, 7:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are a special type of _puja_ that we did last night. It was a especially arranged puja arranged by Mom and Dad to thank God for my internship. I met him after I don't know how long. But the gate that you see in the pics is  made of Silver. It is like a 300 year old temple and on of the most coveted temples of Lord Krishna. The rituals followed here are equally worthy. This gate is the gate of the room in which the idol of Kunj Behari Ji resides. Each night after the door closes. The doorstep of the room is decorated and worshipped. It is so because they feel that the doorstep is  an embodiment of Behari Ji's feet and  worshipping him, the God of all Gods is an honor in itself. Honestly, it's like a Tsunami of people the whole day but in that last one hour, it was so quiet and peaceful and the puja was so good. I won't say I am religious but I won't say I am atheist either. Having met you, and after you denied doing Diwali Puja, I was very unsure of my religious roots. Because, having gone to the church with you and attend the service, I was seriously questioning what is religion. Why do we do what we do? And I realized that to find all those answers in one life is impossible. Especially in Hindi mythology. Every word has a story. Seriously, every word. So, I was thinking it can't be that if you want to connect with that superpower you have to do such complicated ceremonies everytime. You know how I believe in the superpower theory and how one can get insights into the brain by looking into their own selves like connecting with their deeper selves. I hope you do, that was the theory I told you about in our meeting in the first cafe. I believe whenever you connect with that deeper inner self and hence with that superpower you will always feel that something is right. To me dance and music somewhere is about that. And so is religion. So, yeah I believe in every ceremony, and every religion because I believe somewhere it gives a chance for people to get that high and to find that connect. But still, I always feel that the answers to the biggest questions are the simplest. So I was wondering, while I was doing the puja that is this even relevant or is this even worth my time and then when I had goosebumps for no reason then I was sure, that yeah, maybe it has a deeper meaning to itself. Like every other millions of  temples the value proposition is the same for this one too, whatever you wish for gets true. My mother says she wished for my internship. Ok maybe wish sounds selfish. Maybe pray? So I thought what can I ask for? I always ask for "sadbuddhi" that translates to a brighter mind. Brighter doesn't mean sharper. It just simply means a mind that thinks better works better is morally correct and does what is right for itself and others. So I always ask for that but this time I had more to ask for. I asked him to take away my thoughts of infidelity and make you mine. I asked him to unite us and make us inseparable. I wished for it politely. I would want you to be wish with me, for us, in this very temple and that is why I wanted you to come. But then I was thinking how comfortable would you be worshipping other gods. Anyways, the goosebumps told me that the Aura and the divinity of the place were both conducive for any such reverence being held towards it. So I just wished for it and hoped that it will be taken care of. I don't know if this is somehow quantifiable as in, yeah if it ever gets fulfilled to a certain extent then I can do such puja for our Union. Maybe marriage is a marker yes, but then again, I have would want to do it on a pro rata basis with you. In advanced. I am pretty sure I want to spend a significant chunk of my life with you. I mean I want it to be as many lives as I can wish for but that is only something I can wish. To make it happen I also need luck and many things to go my way. So I want to pray there with you. So that it's from both our sides. I very rarely wish for things other than a sound mind in a temple. I just kept wishing about yes yesterday and I think it's a common thing in many of my upcoming prayers. I love you and I always want to be with you. Good morning
6/17/19, 10:24 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning rakkaimpani. This blew my mind.
6/17/19, 10:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤯
6/17/19, 10:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you like to say more?
6/17/19, 10:58 AM - Shona 😍: I'm still trying to collect the pieces after the blast
6/17/19, 11:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well what a choice of words 😄🤭
6/17/19, 11:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My question to you is why is your mind blown?
6/17/19, 12:26 PM - Shona 😍: Any time something has to do with religion it is. I get a thousand questions in my head and very few answers. And I'm very surprised that you met your dad again. I wonder how you felt about that?
6/17/19, 1:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought because you liked the message
6/17/19, 1:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok maybe I am being too self centered
6/17/19, 1:54 PM - Shona 😍: Shona I'm gonna write more about it

6/17/19, 1:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
6/17/19, 1:55 PM - Shona 😍: No! We're gonna go to another one 😁

6/17/19, 1:57 PM - Shona 😍: Like there was this ramp you had to climb and then get on the swing, and it went on for like 60 or 70 meters!!
6/17/19, 1:57 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
6/17/19, 1:57 PM - Shona 😍: Gonna send you when we get wifi again
6/17/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wtf?!

6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See
6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I told you so
6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭
6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: It is!!
6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It gets better
6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: It is amazing
6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It always does
6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can tell from experience

6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: So different from before
6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: No one's complaining
6/17/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay!
6/17/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe we are just more mature, us kids 😬
6/17/19, 1:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seeing my father and the change in him yesterday, I must say, I think everyone can change
6/17/19, 1:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe. Or maybe that all this inclination to religion changed people
6/17/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: Oh I want to hear more about that?
6/17/19, 2:01 PM - Shona 😍: I mean when you want to tell
6/17/19, 2:01 PM - Shona 😍: What are you referring to with that?
6/17/19, 2:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being more close to his religious roots I can see my father is more sure of himself and he is more
6/17/19, 2:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I'm touch with himself
6/17/19, 2:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He is able to embrace himself better
6/17/19, 2:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/17/19, 2:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you 😢
6/17/19, 2:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh god I miss you
6/17/19, 2:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why do even fucking say it
6/17/19, 2:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Have been saying that for the past 6 months now
6/17/19, 2:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😓
6/17/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: Rakas!!!!!
6/17/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: 16 more days
6/17/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: And then we meet again
6/17/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: I'm still thinking about that religion bit
6/17/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: And writing about it
6/17/19, 2:59 PM - Shona 😍: I miss you too. So much. And I know it seems so hollow to keep saying it but it still means a lot to hear it and say it. The meaning doesn't go away.
6/17/19, 3:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: True
6/17/19, 3:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh god. I am wondering what will come out of you 🤭
6/17/19, 3:03 PM - Shona 😍: Hehe. I put my theologian cap on for a bit
6/17/19, 3:04 PM - Shona 😍: But also I'm distracted with the beautiful sceneries and talking with everyone so that's why thinking and writing is slow too
6/17/19, 3:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thats fine.
6/17/19, 3:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Family first
6/17/19, 3:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Always
6/17/19, 3:04 PM - Shona 😍: You are my family too shona
6/17/19, 3:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤗
6/17/19, 3:54 PM - Shona 😍: Religion is a very fascinating aspect of our human lives. Even when I was studying theology at the university and taking courses in comparative religion, the professors told us how difficult it is to define what it actually is. There are countless different ways of trying to do that, and scholars have come up with their own systems for trying to understand the different dimensions of religions. But of course the "scientific" study (studying it from the outside and trying to stay neutral in relation to the doctrinal claims of the religions for example) of religion can be very different from the experiential world of the people actually practicing the religions. 
Maybe because religion is escaping from all the definitions it was so astonishing to study, both in good and bad. It certainly gave me new perspectives in relation to my own religious roots and practises, and it also left me very much confused. If no one even understands what exactly religion is, what are we supposed to do with it? Is it still something good and valuable to have? What about all the horrible things done in the name of different religions? How do we cooperate globally with our different religious backgrounds? What are we to make of from the different doctrinal claims of different religions? Is one religion more "true" than another in some aspects or not? For example actual historical evidence for some events that took place. Are the religions just essentially talking about the same thing but just with different terms and languages, or are they fundamentally different? The holy scriptures of the religions can certainly be interpreted in countless different ways. How much are those ways different for us today from the time when they were written? And what are we to make of those differences then? For example the books of the Bible were written around 2000 years ago, and the oldest Vedas even 3500 years ago! How different is the world today from those days! And a very interesting question is, how similar are we as humans to the people living at that time? Maybe we haven't changed that much, in some aspects of our lives. Many still seem to find meaning in the same scriptires. One could spend a lifetime studying these questions and many choose to do so. Religion astonishes me. It seems impossible for me to separate all these questions when I try to practice it myself, and that's why it all feels so complicated to me. I don't know what church to go to or what would it mean if I were to participate in a puja.
6/17/19, 3:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙉🤷🏻‍♂
6/17/19, 3:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to discuss these questions with me?
6/17/19, 3:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I might have an answer to them
6/17/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: Surely we can
6/17/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/17/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: Yes, on text we can
6/17/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: We're on the road
6/17/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure
6/17/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: Please say
6/17/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Arrey
6/17/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just like that
6/17/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing special
6/17/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
6/17/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok a question
6/17/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May I ask
6/17/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: Please
6/17/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will you ever check out women with me?
6/17/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: I don't really like it
6/17/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: Why would you want to do it?
6/17/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. I find very liberating and a very healthy sign of a relationship
6/17/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also it is something of a preference
6/17/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: So we should check out men too?
6/17/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: [cries in a shrill voice] yes of course!!!!
6/17/19, 8:08 PM - Shona 😍: According to whom it is a very healthy sign of a relationship? I'm just asking
6/17/19, 8:11 PM - Shona 😍: To me it sounds just like an opinion or preference
6/17/19, 8:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To me
6/17/19, 8:12 PM - Shona 😍: So
6/17/19, 8:12 PM - Shona 😍: It's a preference
6/17/19, 8:13 PM - Shona 😍: Did you feel that doing it improved your relationship with Sukriti?
6/17/19, 8:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I said "I"
6/17/19, 8:14 PM - Shona 😍: Ok my bad
6/17/19, 8:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: During the days it was so, I felt better yes. And after that I felt suffocated yes. So thinking only about myself it did give me benefits. But it did give her insecurities
6/17/19, 8:17 PM - Shona 😍: Well doesn't that sound like a sign of a very healthy relationship
6/17/19, 8:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There were other aspects to it
6/17/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd I told you the whole story because you deserve to know
6/17/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that doesn't mean that it will be the same for us
6/17/19, 8:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you think you will feel insecure if we discuss other women?
6/17/19, 8:21 PM - Shona 😍: What in particular would you want to discuss about other women?
6/17/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There are so many things. But more of the looks and the sex appeal
6/17/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: So, would you want to tell me what you'd want to do to them? How you'd like to fuck them?
6/17/19, 8:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well you don't seem to take it well so I am going to stop
6/17/19, 8:28 PM - Shona 😍: I'm just being as straight about it as I can.
6/17/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: What else would it be for than that?
6/17/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Using that language in a sensitive discussion such as this doesn't help the cause
6/17/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I am being unreasonable
6/17/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But there is a way to talk
6/17/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can be straight as well
6/17/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that doesn't help
6/17/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A little minding the language and tone helps.
6/17/19, 8:31 PM - Shona 😍: I don't understand what you meant with what you're saying then
6/17/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok maybe it's my fault
6/17/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are right there is no point being diplomatic
6/17/19, 8:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But if you are saying it as a matter of factly and not attaching emotions to it then yeah I think that's the better way to talk
6/17/19, 8:32 PM - Shona 😍: Of course I'm attaching emotions to it too
6/17/19, 8:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then I have a question for you
6/17/19, 8:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If that is how against you are
6/17/19, 8:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of me having such thoughts
6/17/19, 8:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then how is it any different now
6/17/19, 8:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I have them even now
6/17/19, 8:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry but that's how it goes for me and I seriously have no control over those
6/17/19, 8:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Discussing or not discussing is so secondary
6/17/19, 8:34 PM - Shona 😍: Sure. But there is all the difference in having thoughts and then following them and paying more attention to them. That's a choice, to some extent at least
6/17/19, 8:34 PM - Shona 😍: Also
6/17/19, 8:34 PM - Shona 😍: You didn't answer my question
6/17/19, 8:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please ask
6/17/19, 8:35 PM - Shona 😍: ?
6/17/19, 8:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not necessarily. Sometimes I find someone pretty, happens to me all the time, not just women, old men as well. Sometimes someone looks hot. Maybe a guy may be a girl. Sometimes I can't help but notice if someone's strap is showing and I go back to my porn mind and then I imagine how they would look naked. How would they behave when they crave for someone? Is it in line with how they seem or are they a different person. Sometimes, I see someone, find them hot and then later have a dirty dream and I want to let it out. Tell you how hot or silly it was. Or ask you if that makes me a bad person or tell you that I feel bad that it was not about you. Or sometimes simply say that it was so hot that I don't care. It's a mixed bag. But I don't think it's just that what you asked.
6/17/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: I see
6/17/19, 8:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why I ask you this is because I think I have really appreciated that in a woman in the past and mentally I feel really free and in my heart I feel more attached to that person. I respect them more for their worldview and their neutrality and maturity. Each day in the world there are so many things happening around, transactions of words, money, data etc. _I_ don't think every thing being transaction is fair. It's a mixed bag. People are benign but so are they notorious. Everything is possible and indeed everything happens. good and bad. There can't be a bad without a good. And vice a versa. Acknowledging the bad keeps you in touch with reality, be aware of it, and helps you appreciate the good. If a woman doesn't respect my bad side and wants me to curb it and only wants to listen to my good side then I don't want to be with such a woman, I think I have my fair share of vices and I want to be with someone who acknowledges those and respects them. That doesn't mean that you have to discuss women with me. I think you acknowledge my vices and you really give me the freedom to be the man the man that I am. But that being said, as we discussed, it's a preference. Its something I appreciate and makes me adore my women even more. To me it's a statement of trust and unconditional love. Of course, there are many others but nothing like it. Also, I really think that talking to you about it will help me let it out of my system and react to it neutrally. To know that yes that's just a normal thing to think and it's ok. So that I can feel less guilty and hence more liberated.
6/17/19, 8:51 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. If that is something that happenes occasionally, I don't think I would mind that much. But if it's something that happens all the time, I find it a bit problematic to me. Because I don't want my own mind to get super strongly sex-centered
6/17/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How do you even do that? I am talking to you about such a sensitive topic about how I feel insecure and how can you make it about yourself and how you want to hedge yourself?

And please stop me if I am misunderstanding
6/17/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *woman
6/17/19, 8:53 PM - Shona 😍: I think you are
6/17/19, 8:53 PM - Shona 😍: I'm trying to understand what you're saying. But something like this isn't only about you, it affects me too
6/17/19, 8:54 PM - Shona 😍: I hear you, when you say all that. I can understand
6/17/19, 8:55 PM - Shona 😍: You wrote so much about what it means to you but I can't say one thing how I feel about it?
6/17/19, 8:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you can. I am sorry. I was being biased
6/17/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But wait a second
6/17/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I have those thoughts all the time.
6/17/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At least now a days
6/17/19, 9:01 PM - Shona 😍: What I mean is that I don't want to talk about it all the time. I don't. Occasionally, yeah sure, probably. But I also want to focus on other things in life. And I think, that you're having those thoughts so much these days because you feel somewhat deprived of sex. We are not even having phone sex atm and it's been 6 months since you were here. So I think those thoughts are gonna come to you more in this kind of time.
6/17/19, 9:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I don't like them
6/17/19, 9:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel so filthy
6/17/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't just keep hating myself
6/17/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously
6/17/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't
6/17/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yes you are right what am I even saying
6/17/19, 9:02 PM - Shona 😍: And then you feel guilty again? And then you think about it even more?
6/17/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't keep talking about it
6/17/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then I will think about it more
6/17/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the start of an addiction
6/17/19, 9:04 PM - Shona 😍: As we have talked about it before. I think feeling guilty about it makes it exponentially worse
6/17/19, 9:05 PM - Shona 😍: Makes you think about it even more and all the negative emotions want to take over
6/17/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am so hollow without you
6/17/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: These subtleties make me want to love you more.
6/17/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The way your values are so flawless.
6/17/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am really in an awe.
6/17/19, 9:15 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry baby we're about to reach and I need to help with navigation
6/17/19, 9:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's ok Mera baby
6/17/19, 9:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you
6/17/19, 9:36 PM - Shona 😍: It's completely normal for you to think about sex, and notice other people too. Especially now that we're not physically together. Though even when we are, I think we're still gonna notice other people too. As overall you don't want an open relationship (and neither do I), I think also the sexual focus should be on each other. And I think it will happen naturally if most of the other aspects in our relationship are well. But noticing other people and getting ideas from fantasies for our sex life can happen too.
6/17/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: Ok we reached
6/17/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: Gonna go have dinner now
6/17/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: We're in Poland ✌🏻
6/17/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: And yes, I know you think Polish women are hot 😁
6/17/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry I made it sexual for you😓😢
6/17/19, 9:58 PM - Shona 😍: Also, one more thing came to my mind about the insecurity part. I don't think it makes me feel very good about myself if it's more often that you tell me how hot you find other women, and more rarely tell me that you think I'm sexy. I'm not saying that you do that atm. Somehow I just have a feeling that that ratio will matter. And I'm not asking you to praise me all the time. Maybe you understand what I mean by this.
6/17/19, 9:58 PM - Shona 😍: And changing the topic: oh God the Polish beer is good 😍
6/17/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm ofc if you don't find me hot anymore at some point you shouldn't lie 🤔 ok I'm thinking too much no2
6/18/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: Okay now the fighting has started 😅
6/18/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: People getting stressed and tired. Okay mostly mum was being aggressive and grumpy. But Laura told her to go to sleep and we will handle the rest of the planning... That's was probably for the best
6/18/19, 1:48 AM - Shona 😍: I guess you slept already
6/18/19, 1:49 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
6/18/19, 10:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning kulta
6/18/19, 11:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Puccha for my baby
6/18/19, 12:22 PM - Shona 😍: Good morning
6/18/19, 12:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you ok baby?
6/18/19, 12:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me know if you get a WiFi and you want to call
6/18/19, 1:00 PM - Shona 😍: You just stopped talking last night without saying anything and that never feels nice. Other than that I'm fine.
6/18/19, 1:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
6/18/19, 1:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was not sure what to say
6/18/19, 1:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also I got high
6/18/19, 1:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry I didn't say
6/18/19, 2:27 PM - Shona 😍: Ok. In the future, baby can you please just tell me if you're gonna do that so that I don't need to be wondering what's going on?
6/18/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know I should have. But I was sad and I didn't want to speak to anyone
6/18/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So the advice works but I cant vouch for such times
6/18/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: So you will just go quiet?
6/18/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: That's been my specialty
6/18/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: Hasn't been working too well for us
6/18/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: You could've talked to me
6/18/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fair point well made
6/18/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I didn't go quiet because I was pissed or anything
6/18/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just felt
6/18/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I need to think before I say anything more about it
6/18/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's why
6/18/19, 3:50 PM - Shona 😍: And that's the feeling I've had.
6/18/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am a fool who is just blabbering and confusing people
6/18/19, 3:51 PM - Shona 😍: But maybe it's different for you. Since you usually do talk
6/18/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did it change?
6/18/19, 3:51 PM - Shona 😍: The feeling in that moment?
6/18/19, 3:53 PM - Shona 😍: Overall I've noticed that it's gonna get better after we have talked about it properly.
6/18/19, 4:01 PM - Shona 😍: I can be on video call in the evening, even if there's no wifi
6/18/19, 4:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you hate me?
6/18/19, 4:22 PM - Shona 😍: No baby
6/18/19, 4:22 PM - Shona 😍: You know I love you
6/18/19, 4:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why not.
6/18/19, 4:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have every reason to
6/18/19, 4:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This being the most immediate one.
6/18/19, 4:36 PM - Shona 😍: I don't like that but it doesn't mean I hate you
6/18/19, 4:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am going to get high today too
6/18/19, 4:45 PM - Shona 😍: Can we please talk before that?
6/18/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know if I have much to say
6/18/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: Still Shona
6/18/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: We haven't talked in ages
6/18/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: It's always been better after we do
6/18/19, 5:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think I want to try time
6/18/19, 5:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *this time
6/18/19, 5:59 PM - Shona 😍: Mera shona. What has happened?
6/18/19, 6:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't bother baby. I will handle myself and fix myself
6/18/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: You're shutting me out.
6/18/19, 7:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I tend to do that.
6/18/19, 7:16 PM - Shona 😍: Not with me
6/18/19, 7:27 PM - Shona 😍: You can tell me anything
6/18/19, 7:28 PM - Shona 😍: And we can find a solution
6/18/19, 7:29 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe not right away
6/18/19, 7:29 PM - Shona 😍: But eventually
6/18/19, 7:47 PM - Shona 😍: And when you do that
6/18/19, 7:47 PM - Shona 😍: It feels like I'm not your partner
6/18/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: But just some random girl to you
6/18/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
6/19/19, 2:34 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
6/19/19, 8:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
6/19/19, 10:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby. Let me know when we can speak on call
6/19/19, 12:15 PM - Shona 😍: Good morning
6/19/19, 1:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you like to speak on call sometime today!
6/19/19, 1:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *
6/19/19, 1:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *?
6/19/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: Sure
6/19/19, 2:37 PM - Shona 😍: We're gonna reach Austria today
6/19/19, 2:38 PM - Shona 😍: And meet Benita and drop Mikko and his stuff to the apartment
6/19/19, 2:38 PM - Shona 😍: The rest of us are gonna stay at a camping site again because their apartment is very small
6/19/19, 2:39 PM - Shona 😍: But I don't know what time I'll be free
6/19/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's ok. I will wait for my darling. Unless it gets very late.
6/19/19, 3:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you
6/19/19, 3:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wish Mikko all the best from my side.
6/19/19, 3:25 PM - Shona 😍: Wow my parents are fighting over driving and navigation 😅 oh God!!!! Reminds me of our fight that time huhhuh
6/19/19, 3:25 PM - Shona 😍: I will
6/19/19, 3:26 PM - Shona 😍: Okay it's a nastier fight
6/19/19, 3:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I seriously can't imagine Annika fighting or getting angry
6/19/19, 3:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been wondering that fir the past two days
6/19/19, 3:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Many days actually
6/19/19, 3:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We fight way less and I am very happy
6/19/19, 3:29 PM - Shona 😍: Oh god it's nasty
6/19/19, 3:29 PM - Shona 😍: Me too
6/19/19, 3:35 PM - Shona 😍: And now I'm like doing analysis on it, it's easier to stand it that way. To me it sounds like dad is lacking in empathizing and mum is expecting him to read her thoughts to know when she needs help
6/19/19, 3:42 PM - Shona 😍: And now they calmed down and made up and apologized 🤯
6/19/19, 3:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I somehow think we fight very less
6/19/19, 3:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think we should fight more.
6/19/19, 3:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄🤭
6/19/19, 3:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Kidding ofc
6/19/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: Well we don't know how it's gonna be when we actually live together 😁
6/19/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think it will be any different
6/19/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We just are two very compliant people
6/19/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We both mostly agree to what the other has to say
6/19/19, 3:56 PM - Shona 😍: I many things yeah
6/19/19, 3:57 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm maybe we should fight more indeed
6/19/19, 3:57 PM - Shona 😍: I'm also kidding
6/19/19, 3:58 PM - Shona 😍: Kinda
6/19/19, 3:59 PM - Shona 😍: But no need to deliberately start a fight  😁
6/19/19, 4:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe sometimes we can.
6/19/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then laugh about it
6/19/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: While fighting
6/19/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like a very silly role play
6/19/19, 5:00 PM - Shona 😍: Interesting idea
6/19/19, 6:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Any updates for me?
6/19/19, 6:41 PM - Shona 😍: We're driving through Czech Republic atm
6/19/19, 6:41 PM - Shona 😍: It's really warm
6/19/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: 28 degrees
6/19/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: About 200km left
6/19/19, 6:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's 36 here rn
6/19/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: Hehe
6/19/19, 6:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a question for you
6/19/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: But hey that's super nice compared to 44
6/19/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: Shoot
6/19/19, 6:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
6/19/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you leave me if you were to know that I think about how I find others sexy all the time and I fantasize about them all the time?
6/19/19, 6:45 PM - Shona 😍: Can we please discuss that on call
6/19/19, 6:48 PM - Shona 😍: I think that's temporary. Think about it. Were you like that when you were with me in Finland? Have you been doing that all this while for the 6 months we've been apart? Or only at times, sometimes more, sometimes less?
6/19/19, 6:50 PM - Shona 😍: And I have a question for you. Why would _you_ want to be with me if you think and fantasize about others all the time?
6/19/19, 6:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Almost all the while. I mean when I feel really very close to you then it automatically stops otherwise it has pretty much stayed
6/19/19, 6:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think it works that way? But to answer your question. I love you and I have pretty much thought my life through with you. What I think about others is just an automatic thing to me. I can't stop it, I can't fix it. It just happens. I have pretty much accepted it as a flaw and I think it will be the reason for you to leave me.
6/19/19, 6:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's what scares me
6/19/19, 6:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Has scared me
6/19/19, 6:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And will probably haunt me for the rest of my life.
6/19/19, 7:00 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow I think you've made it into a bigger deal than it actually is
6/19/19, 7:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I believe so too
6/19/19, 7:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am more than happy to gav it anyway- the discussion- rather than not discussing it at all
6/19/19, 7:02 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
6/19/19, 7:02 PM - Shona 😍: I would very much prefer having the discussion on call though
6/19/19, 7:03 PM - Shona 😍: I have been thinking about it for the past two days
6/19/19, 7:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Same
6/19/19, 7:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure
6/19/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: Altough I don't know when we can do that
6/19/19, 7:05 PM - Shona 😍: So maybe we should text
6/19/19, 7:06 PM - Shona 😍: Ugh but seriously I think call is so much better with such topics
6/19/19, 7:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I suppose
6/19/19, 7:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I agree
6/19/19, 7:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The reason why these things are coming up now is because
6/19/19, 7:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We have waited sufficiently long at least imo after my porn addiction
6/19/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For us to know that these things are not related to that
6/19/19, 7:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And very recently my office friend told me that it's fine to check out other people and think in that way about them
6/19/19, 7:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I am seriously thinking whats right or wrong
6/19/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand
6/19/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: Well you're being open and honest about it with me so I think that's good
6/19/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: But still I think this is the biggest problem
6/19/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: I understand that it is something sensitive to you
6/19/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: So I try to really understand what's going on
6/19/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the thing. It is not!
6/19/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is not to me
6/19/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then I was thinking
6/19/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That if it is to you
6/19/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then you may leave me some day for it
6/19/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if that is the case I want to know and be prepared
6/19/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because let me tell you something
6/19/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That if you were to ever turn into that angry self that we talked about
6/19/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not walking away even after that
6/19/19, 7:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To me it perfectly human to do so. But I know it is for you.
6/19/19, 7:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *it is not
6/19/19, 7:30 PM - Shona 😍: See. I have such thoughts sometimes too, probably most people do. For example the hot nurse at work that was checking me out and whom I found sexy too? The thought did cross my mind that how would it feel or look like if we had sex together. But that thought just passed by so fast and I didn't pay any more attention to it. If I started worrying about the thought and feel guilty about it and panic and keep telling you how I can't stop thinking about it or that I shouldn't be thinking about it... I would think about it so much more. And make it into a serious problem myself.
6/19/19, 7:31 PM - Shona 😍: And I have told you before that I have such thoughts too
6/19/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: And that's where you're wrong
6/19/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: That it's not to me
6/19/19, 7:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But this.
6/19/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: What about that
6/19/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you have no problem with me having that thoughts and you think they are fine then why do you think that it is somehow related to me wanting to be with you.
6/19/19, 7:42 PM - Shona 😍: Well you just made it sound like that's all you do all day. And that it worries you. So then I thought if that's all you do then wouldn't you rather just spend your days doing just that and there's no point for us to be together. This is just all an enormous hyperbole. Don't take it seriously. The point is that you made it sound like it's a huge deal for you, or that's what I understood of what you said
6/19/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think it is anyhow related. I have those thoughts but I don't care about the women who they are and I don't even want to pursue them. I want to spend my life with you and you are the only thing that matters and I think when we make our memories there is a healthy chance that they are going to replace many such thoughts.
6/19/19, 7:44 PM - Shona 😍: And that's what matters to me.
6/19/19, 7:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: These days yes. That is what I end up doing all day. Checking people out. Maybe it was about me being new to Delhi. Because nowadays I understand that it has reduced significantly. But I seriously was wondering how would you react if you were to know that I am like that. I know myself and I have no regrets whatsoever. I just thought that you really trust me with yourself and am I letting _us_ down. Me was fine. But the _us_ in me was not because it was afraid that _you_ are being cheated on and thereby hurting _us_ but now we are so fine with it. So I can calm down I guess.
6/19/19, 7:56 PM - Shona 😍: Baby please. Yes, calm down. The thoughts are fine. I think the only way I will have a problem with it if that's what you want to _talk about_ all the time. Because that will be boring to me, and that's not what I want to do with my mental space all day. I want to focus on other things in life too.
6/19/19, 7:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Agreed and that I think is how it should be
6/19/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also
6/19/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thanks for finally telling me.
6/19/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About this.
6/19/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭
6/19/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You naughty girlm
6/19/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *girl
6/19/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: I already told it before 🙄  okay not explicitly like that
6/19/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: Btw
6/19/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: We crossed the Austrian border ✌🏻
6/19/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: About 90km left until we reach Benita's
6/19/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: And Mikko's, from today on 😃
6/19/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know if I should feel happy or sad
6/19/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: About
6/19/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mikko
6/19/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean
6/19/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
6/19/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He is just 18 yaar
6/19/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙄
6/19/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: 19!
6/19/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: He just had his birthday
6/19/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tomato tomato
6/19/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: But yeah I get the point
6/19/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: I think he will be fine :)
6/19/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: I really hope so. I hope he will be happier here.
6/19/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know where the difference matters?
6/19/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of +-1?
6/19/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In our countdown.
6/19/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Which is just 15 days now
6/19/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: I think it's 14?
6/19/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: Yes it's 14
6/19/19, 8:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ♥
6/19/19, 8:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok I suddenly feel really fine again
6/19/19, 8:18 PM - Shona 😍: Baby.
6/19/19, 8:18 PM - Shona 😍: I love you.
6/19/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😢
6/19/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you too
6/19/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Love me like you do🎼
6/19/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My god have I missed you
6/19/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My god did I feel like it was the end
6/19/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My god did I feel like I broke your heart
6/19/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😢
6/19/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you baby
6/19/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Never leave me please
6/19/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know what I'd do
6/19/19, 9:58 PM - Shona 😍: I wish you would've discussed it with me sooner
6/19/19, 9:58 PM - Shona 😍: But I can understand
6/19/19, 9:59 PM - Shona 😍: I've done the same before
6/19/19, 9:59 PM - Shona 😍: And maybe sometimes it needs more time
6/19/19, 9:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But this. Is every bit as true
6/19/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: I love you too
6/19/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is my Shona doing
6/19/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is she?
6/19/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does she miss me too?
6/19/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did she reach Mikko's?
6/19/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: My ass is dead from all the sitting
6/19/19, 10:00 PM - Shona 😍: 8km left
6/19/19, 10:01 PM - Shona 😍: But there's traffic jam
6/19/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Come here. Let me lick it
6/19/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭🙈🙊
6/19/19, 10:01 PM - Shona 😍: So we don't know how long it's gonna take
6/19/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 👅
6/19/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know what else is jammed?
6/19/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My heart
6/19/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With all your loooooove
6/19/19, 10:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona I am sleepy

6/20/19, 10:43 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
6/20/19, 11:37 AM - Shona 😍: I'm still a bit bogged down by what happened earlier. You haven't refused to talk like that before. I know I have, and you have told me before that you might do something like that, so in a way it's okay. But it bothers me that I don't know what were you thinking back then.
6/20/19, 11:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand. But when can we talk about it?
6/20/19, 11:40 AM - Shona 😍: I think I should have time today. We're gonna spend the day exploring Vienna
6/20/19, 11:40 AM - Shona 😍: What are your plans today?
6/20/19, 11:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😍😍😍
6/20/19, 11:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Missing you. 
Missing you, and let me check, I may have something else, yes! Checking the countdown and then more missing you.
6/20/19, 11:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤭
6/20/19, 11:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you baby
6/20/19, 11:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a presentation tomorrow
6/20/19, 11:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So got to work on that
6/20/19, 11:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then more working on the presentation
6/20/19, 12:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You didn't say anything baby
6/20/19, 12:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, how did it go last night with Benita and Mikko?
6/20/19, 12:11 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry
6/20/19, 12:11 PM - Shona 😍: I tried to sleep more
6/20/19, 12:12 PM - Shona 😍: The time difference is 3.5h here btw
6/20/19, 12:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh🤭
6/20/19, 12:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry. I didn't know.
6/20/19, 12:13 PM - Shona 😍: So I didn't understand if you will have time to talk today or if you will just be working on the presentation 😅
6/20/19, 12:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always have time for you baby
6/20/19, 12:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will
6/20/19, 12:15 PM - Shona 😍: Very nicely. We stayed there for some food and planned the rest of our stay. We're gonna meet in about an hour and start the tour then. Tomorrow we're gonna meet Benita's parents for the first time!
6/20/19, 12:15 PM - Shona 😍: 🥰😘
6/20/19, 12:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tour of?

6/20/19, 12:17 PM - Shona 😍: Just going around the city
6/20/19, 12:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sure it is nice.
6/20/19, 12:18 PM - Shona 😍: Me toooooo!!
6/20/19, 12:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wasn't one of the Dan Brown's was placed in Vienna
6/20/19, 12:19 PM - Shona 😍: I haven't read his books

6/20/19, 12:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I video call you rn?
6/20/19, 12:55 PM - Shona 😍: For a bit yeah
6/20/19, 1:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry that I make you feel that way
6/20/19, 2:29 PM - Shona 😍: Whatever
6/20/19, 2:30 PM - Shona 😍: I don't even understand what that was about
6/20/19, 3:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. I am sorry that I criticize you all the time
6/20/19, 3:16 PM - Shona 😍: That's not true
6/20/19, 3:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am saying this in a very matter of factly way. Not any emotional drama. And yes that is labelling and not exactly true. I also make you smile and I was just telling someone at my workplace how I am able to make you smile much more quickly these days and how pretty you look when you do that. 😍♥
6/20/19, 3:44 PM - Shona 😍: ☺

6/20/19, 3:47 PM - Shona 😍: It's also super hot 🥵
6/20/19, 3:47 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm

6/20/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: Seriously the area is several hectares
6/20/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: And mum didn't climb as far either
6/20/19, 3:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh

6/20/19, 6:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh you are talking about December
6/20/19, 6:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
6/20/19, 6:41 PM - Shona 😍: Nope

6/20/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Congratulations
6/20/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have earned a certificate
6/20/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: 😝

6/20/19, 6:46 PM - Shona 😍: Probably.

6/20/19, 6:47 PM - Shona 😍: Gotcha 😄
6/20/19, 6:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Want to see magic?

6/20/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know that it didn't work

6/20/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣🤣😅
6/20/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bad magician
6/20/19, 6:50 PM - Shona 😍: Oh wow 😅😅
6/20/19, 6:51 PM - Shona 😍: Aren't you a wizard
6/20/19, 6:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was I right?
6/20/19, 6:51 PM - Shona 😍: Ahem.... I had no clue what was going on
6/20/19, 6:53 PM - Shona 😍: Rn I feel tired
6/20/19, 6:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thanks😌
6/20/19, 6:53 PM - Shona 😍: I'm also a bit tipsy 🤭
6/20/19, 6:54 PM - Shona 😍: Okay not anymore
6/20/19, 6:54 PM - Shona 😍: But I had a large beer
6/20/19, 6:54 PM - Shona 😍: 😬
6/20/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
6/20/19, 7:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Arrey
6/20/19, 7:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What's there to ask
6/20/19, 7:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just say
6/20/19, 7:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That
6/20/19, 7:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to talk in an hour
6/20/19, 7:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Rest I will handle
6/20/19, 7:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't you know you are my princess?
6/20/19, 7:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When will you behave like one?
6/20/19, 7:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tell me. Tell me. Huh? Tell me!
6/20/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: You would not like me if I behaved like that
6/20/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: Trust me
6/20/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But but but
6/20/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am curious now
6/20/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you like that
6/20/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean as far as I know
6/20/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are not
6/20/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But are you?
6/20/19, 7:20 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not
6/20/19, 7:20 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I have that side
6/20/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: I mean I have been thinking about it
6/20/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh? How so?
6/20/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: But she's a bitch
6/20/19, 7:23 PM - Shona 😍: Related to the looks discussion, and checking out other people
6/20/19, 7:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will you ever show me that side?
6/20/19, 7:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What about it?
6/20/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: Why would you want to see it? It's just basically mean, self-centered and insecure
6/20/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: Confident is different
6/20/19, 7:32 PM - Shona 😍: At least that's how I understand it
6/20/19, 7:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a question for you
6/20/19, 7:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why would you hide it?
6/20/19, 7:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: From me.
6/20/19, 7:33 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's hiding
6/20/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: It's just a matter of the direction in which I want to develop my character
6/20/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: Okay maybe it's not that simple
6/20/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: But I have been mean
6/20/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: In the past
6/20/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah but development and all is fine. But part of the development is in part being a part of both the characters and if you are in so said developmental stage then how come I have never seen that side
6/20/19, 7:35 PM - Shona 😍: Well maybe it's all gone already then 🤔
6/20/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: Or maybe it's only been in my head then
6/20/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: But no
6/20/19, 7:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, not that I did it on purpose. But how did it feel like when I didn't show up with my sad face at all? Or even worse how would it have felt when I would have crushed my sad and depressed and bewildered side under my likeable side?
6/20/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: I have heard other people say I'm mean. But that was several years ago
6/20/19, 7:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Simply said because I want to see every side of you and I am a very very strong believer of the fact that if I can't stand your worst then I don't deserve your best
6/20/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: I think it's mostly this
6/20/19, 7:38 PM - Shona 😍: But some sides yeah, you haven't seen
6/20/19, 7:38 PM - Shona 😍: But seriously I'm not sure if they're even there anymore
6/20/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: People say that about me all the time. I am not. At least not always. So I won't judge myself based on what they say
6/20/19, 7:39 PM - Shona 😍: Though in the past days' discussion, I did remember that side
6/20/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How will you ever know if you never let them breathe?
6/20/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How so? If I may ask?
6/20/19, 7:41 PM - Shona 😍: Or maybe it's another mindset that I had at the same time. Evaluating people, including myself, based on looks. And pretty much only based on that
6/20/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So? Big deal? I think it's fair. I do that too. We all do that. But then you got to give them a second chance. I mean I judge them and I will be aware of my judgement but I won't hold on to it. If they act on it then I know that my stereotype was correct and that I pretty much know them but if they do not fall in line with what I think then I basically just get amazed and an interesting personality
6/20/19, 7:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But how so? I mean what did you want to say?
6/20/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. I think most of the time I didn't think that far. And it was basically just thinking about whether I'm more attractive than someone else or not. I think it was almost pathological for me
6/20/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
6/20/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I never think that people are more good looking than me or not
6/20/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I know most of them are
6/20/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
6/20/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: I was only focused on the looks. I wanted to be a model, and that's all I cared about
6/20/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby I am asking this for the third time.
6/20/19, 8:08 PM - Shona 😍: Because of the looks discussion? That reminded me of that side? When I'm just constantly comparing myself to others
6/20/19, 8:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is this just that?
6/20/19, 8:09 PM - Shona 😍: I think so
6/20/19, 8:10 PM - Shona 😍: But that was so important to me before
6/20/19, 8:10 PM - Shona 😍: Like the most important part of what I am
6/20/19, 8:10 PM - Shona 😍: Because of this
6/20/19, 8:12 PM - Shona 😍: Call?
6/20/19, 8:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
6/20/19, 8:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I won't
6/20/19, 8:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want to talk to kind Hanna.
6/20/19, 8:14 PM - Shona 😍: Call me right now Beriwala
6/20/19, 8:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something moved in my groin
6/20/19, 8:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Uuuuuhh
6/20/19, 8:16 PM - Shona 😍: Please stop
6/20/19, 8:16 PM - Shona 😍: I'm so horny
6/20/19, 8:16 PM - Shona 😍: I haven't masturbated in 5 days
6/20/19, 8:18 PM - Shona 😍: And why aren't you calling
6/20/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Uuuuuhh
6/20/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On it
6/20/19, 8:18 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not gonna wait around all day
6/20/19, 8:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄
6/20/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/20/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: Oh god
6/20/19, 10:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What baby?
6/20/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know how I will handle the next 5 days
6/20/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: I tried to take a nap
6/20/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: All I could think about
6/20/19, 10:47 PM - Shona 😍: Was you fucking me in different positions
6/20/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: You eating me
6/20/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Me eating you
6/20/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Mmmmmmmmmh
6/20/19, 10:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Uuuuh
6/20/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: How are the sandwiches?
6/20/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't have them yet
6/20/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Had my dinner ready
6/20/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry shona
6/20/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now don't ask me what for
6/20/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just felt like saying it
6/20/19, 10:52 PM - Shona 😍: You are the silliest
6/20/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I went to the supermarket and I saw this Indian guy with a foreigner and I was smiling at it. Couldn't stop thinking about you.
6/20/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Am I now?
6/20/19, 10:57 PM - Shona 😍: Soon baby soon ❤❤
6/20/19, 10:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very soon
6/21/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: Are you still working on the presentation?
6/21/19, 12:59 AM - Shona 😍: Btw
6/21/19, 12:59 AM - Shona 😍: Remind me to ask you something the next time we talk on call
6/21/19, 1:08 AM - Shona 😍: Hehe also
6/21/19, 1:10 AM - Shona 😍: Mum and Laura strictly forbade me to elope to get married
6/21/19, 1:11 AM - Shona 😍: We were discussing Mikko's and Benita's marriage and residence permits and citizenships and all
6/21/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: And then we ended up talking about you and me, in relation to the residence permits
6/21/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: And marriage came up too
6/21/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: And then they asked if we have discussed it already
6/21/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: Mum did not seem very happy
6/21/19, 2:01 AM - Shona 😍: You slept again without saying good night?
6/21/19, 2:02 AM - Shona 😍: What am I to you? Your random Finnish buddy?
6/21/19, 2:03 AM - Shona 😍: How about I just get an apartment for myself during my stay there
6/21/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: And maybe you and I can meet over coffee some day, like casual acquaintances do
6/21/19, 2:05 AM - Shona 😍: 🙄

6/21/19, 8:15 PM - Shona 😍: And Laura, mum and dad don't speak it that well either. So Benita was the translator for like half the time
6/21/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So Benita translated in Finnish?
6/21/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: Noo from German to English and English to German

6/21/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *euro
6/21/19, 9:16 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah... Not a fan of the styles though 😅 at least the usual
6/21/19, 9:16 PM - Shona 😍: Of Crocs
6/21/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah me neither
6/21/19, 9:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/21/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But in these there are some likeable ones
6/21/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See why I am saying all this is because I am afraid you will spend something like 150 euros
6/21/19, 9:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😕
6/21/19, 9:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And baby please trust me that you can get plenty for pretty cheap here
6/21/19, 9:23 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
6/21/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: Huhhuh
6/21/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: Shopping done
6/21/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: Are you still up?
6/21/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: Don't kill me
6/21/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: I got 3 pairs of shoes
6/21/19, 10:51 PM - Shona 😍: But all 30-40e for pair
6/21/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is exactly what I was thinking
6/21/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That do I have that effect on you
6/21/19, 11:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂
6/21/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: What effect exactly?
6/21/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know this is exactly what my mother and father had.
6/21/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Conflicts in their own choices
6/21/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not following
6/21/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They both were very much stuck up with their side of things
6/21/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nobody gave up
6/21/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So eventually
6/21/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They both settled in a lifestyle that
6/21/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was difficult for them
6/21/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: But what do you think is the problem here?
6/21/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In the sense that
6/21/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: With us
6/21/19, 11:11 PM - Shona 😍: I just bought some cheap shoes
6/21/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: For Finnish standards, really cheap
6/21/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: And I don't think we can or should make every decision together
6/21/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: That's not even possible
6/21/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/21/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/21/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hope you are not crying or something
6/21/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I was actually kidding with this. I'm not afraid of you. And to me it hasn't seemed like you're very careful with spending, at least when it comes to gadgets. But I hear you, that you have unpleasant memories how things were with your parents.
6/21/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: Nono
6/21/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/21/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: We're at a cafe
6/21/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not a good time to have this conversation then
6/21/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just met Jordan
6/21/19, 11:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😍
6/21/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: Whatever. There doesn't seem to be a good time during the trip so I don't care, I would want to talk
6/21/19, 11:23 PM - Shona 😍: 😍
6/21/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the time so far has been good?
6/21/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: Good time to talk I mean
6/21/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So what 3-4 things define the whole trip
6/21/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ?
6/21/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah, it's been a great!
6/21/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: A great....
6/21/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: Huhhei
6/21/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: Good food, lot of family time, lot of driving, seeing new places
6/21/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I have a question
6/21/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand that it worries you and that you don't want to end up like that. It doesn't worry me that much, maybe because my parents aren't like that at all
6/21/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What are you on?
6/21/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This
6/21/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then this?
6/21/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: You need to be explicit
6/21/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not following
6/21/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Extreme negativity
6/21/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then extreme positivity?
6/21/19, 11:33 PM - Shona 😍: For example, I have a hard time understanding you spending so much money on gadgets. Really hard time. But I tell myself that it's important to you, so it's fine. I don't want to control everything about your spending or what you want to do. Maybe later we need to discuss it more, when we actually live together and have expenses together. But I think some autonomy for spending how we want is needed
6/21/19, 11:34 PM - Shona 😍: Oh I didn't mean it that negatively. That was just stating a fact
6/21/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh
6/21/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: What do you think about this?
6/21/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that doesn't solve the problem
6/21/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hear me out
6/21/19, 11:44 PM - Shona 😍: Please say
6/21/19, 11:44 PM - Shona 😍: I still don't quite understand what is the problem
6/21/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby then let's talk tomorrow
6/21/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: If you want to
6/21/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand that you wouldn't want us to have such mentalities like your parents had
6/21/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
6/21/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: !!
6/21/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: I really like my parents' attitude towards spending
6/21/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: I have hardly ever heard them fight about money
6/21/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not just about money.
6/21/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's about everything
6/21/19, 11:56 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah I understood that
6/21/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: For example choosing the education for our kids is something that needs to be decided together, and we need to find a compromise if we disagree
6/21/19, 11:59 PM - Shona 😍: But in some things I think it's so that we can think how important is the matter to the other person, and if it's much more important to the other one, then they can decide. Just a random example, decorating one room in the house, maybe I don't care as much but it is very important to you to have it certain way, I can let you have your way
6/22/19, 1:26 AM - Shona 😍: Good night shonu
6/22/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm I couldn't sleep yet, I waited too long so it passed
6/22/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: Now I'm thinking about what you said
6/22/19, 2:05 AM - Shona 😍: And I'm wondering what is it that I don't get
6/22/19, 2:10 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe you would like us to agree on things more than I? Is it about the level of independence that we see differently? I gave some concrete examples, but you didn't yet comment on those. Also, I've been listening to the marriage book and it also has advice on learning to live with the conflicts that seem unsolvable. They call them gridlocks, and often times it's possible to work around them and be happy too
6/22/19, 2:13 AM - Shona 😍: Still I'm wondering about what you meant today. Were you upset that I spent that money on shoes? As I said, for Finnish standards those were crazy cheap, and they were great purchases to me. Since it's so incredibly difficult for me to find affordable and fitting shoes, I thought it's wiser to just get them, since I don't know what options they have there. And if they cost 30 euros in India too, they were just as cheap here
6/22/19, 2:13 AM - Shona 😍: For some reason I'm feeling very restless
6/22/19, 2:14 AM - Shona 😍: It was so nice to meet Benita's parents, but it was also exhausting
6/22/19, 2:16 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe it was because I didn't understand much of what was being said, but still I tried to follow the conversation from people's expressions and gestures, and some of the time we spoke in English too. But it was kinda boring and annoying too, not being able to follow the conversation.
6/22/19, 2:17 AM - Shona 😍: I hope I get to hear about your presentation tomorrow
6/22/19, 6:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
6/22/19, 9:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
6/22/19, 9:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will
6/22/19, 9:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: #tbtalked
6/22/19, 9:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. I wonder how you will feel when our parents talk. I mean, my mother and your parents. 👶🏻
Seriously, how will they react😅
6/22/19, 9:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But what do they think about their relationship?
6/22/19, 10:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/ZRdE2Ym4oz4

6/22/19, 2:39 PM - Shona 😍: Oh 😄
6/22/19, 2:40 PM - Shona 😍: Why would I hate you for saying that
6/22/19, 2:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is based on looks
6/22/19, 2:46 PM - Shona 😍: Who was I kidding
6/22/19, 2:46 PM - Shona 😍: I like it when I'm told I look good
6/22/19, 2:46 PM - Shona 😍: But it's not the ONLY thing I want to hear
6/22/19, 2:47 PM - Shona 😍: I mean who doesn't
6/22/19, 2:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. also, a question. Benita's parents seem exhausted? Is life tough for them?
6/22/19, 2:53 PM - Shona 😍: They actually have had some health problems
6/22/19, 2:53 PM - Shona 😍: Her mother is gonna have surgery next week

6/22/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May God bless her
6/22/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If only I had the superpower to heal people
6/22/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think that's the saddest thing that happens to people
6/22/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As if life is not full of challenges already that this had to be one
6/22/19, 2:58 PM - Shona 😍: I know :/
6/22/19, 3:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want you to go back to being your old self but I still feel that you look very pretty and so do I. If not for a formal career. Would you want us be models for each other? Dress up occasionally and click each other? Get a collection of good pics and have them hung in our home on a wall?
6/22/19, 3:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Me in abs, rugged jeans and you in a bikini on a beach. I wonder how we will look.

6/22/19, 11:15 PM - Shona 😍: I'm doing this too often now
6/22/19, 11:15 PM - Shona 😍: Taking time to reply
6/22/19, 11:15 PM - Shona 😍: It's like I'm with others all the time
6/22/19, 11:18 PM - Shona 😍: It's an interesting idea. On one hand I think I should handle my worries on my own. On the other it sounds nice that someone would do it for me. But as I told you before, it's a secured site. I need my identification info for the login, and a code that is different for each login
6/23/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
6/23/19, 12:04 AM - Shona 😍: Is this the one?
6/23/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!!!!
6/23/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the similiar kind of face wash
6/23/19, 12:05 AM - Shona 😍: How many do you want?
6/23/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: two packs of face wash actualluyu
6/23/19, 12:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: just one of aftershave
6/23/19, 12:05 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm let's see if they have it
6/23/19, 12:07 AM - Shona 😍: Is it a similar box?
6/23/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: yes
6/23/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: or you may find it without a boc
6/23/19, 12:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *box
6/23/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: Ok
6/23/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: They didn't have the face wash :/
6/23/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: Actually no face washes at all for men 😅
6/23/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: Well I'll get it from Finland then
6/23/19, 12:47 AM - Shona 😍: Or Germany
6/23/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: thats ok shona
6/23/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: dont stress about it
6/23/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Illu
6/23/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: Now I just want to say
6/23/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: Pillu
6/23/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: But that's not as nice
6/23/19, 12:48 AM - Shona 😍: So illu too
6/23/19, 12:52 AM - Shona 😍: Do you want to talk?
6/23/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: do you really want to ask
6/23/19, 1:00 AM - Shona 😍: ?
6/23/19, 1:01 AM - Shona 😍: Do I want to ask
6/23/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: Can we taaaaaaaaaalk?
6/23/19, 1:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
6/23/19, 1:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
6/23/19, 2:05 AM - Shona 😍: Okay apparently video call is too much for the power bank
6/23/19, 2:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
6/23/19, 2:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/23/19, 2:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You went awfully quiet in the middle
6/23/19, 2:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know you enough to know that you didn't like something
6/23/19, 2:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want you to tell me about it
6/23/19, 2:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby
6/23/19, 2:28 AM - Shona 😍: I think it's just that we haven't talked in a while
6/23/19, 2:28 AM - Shona 😍: Communication with you is sometimes hard
6/23/19, 2:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why?
6/23/19, 2:31 AM - Shona 😍: I think our styles are different, I mean the ones that come to us naturally
6/23/19, 2:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok somehow that worries me
6/23/19, 2:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The way that what you are saying
6/23/19, 2:32 AM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's a good time to talk about that
6/23/19, 2:32 AM - Shona 😍: It's late
6/23/19, 2:33 AM - Shona 😍: We haven't talked in a long time
6/23/19, 2:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There never is
6/23/19, 2:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A good time
6/23/19, 2:33 AM - Shona 😍: True
6/23/19, 2:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So say it
6/23/19, 2:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In direct terms
6/23/19, 2:34 AM - Shona 😍: But say what
6/23/19, 2:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What you didn't like
6/23/19, 2:35 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know if I'm making sense atm
6/23/19, 2:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When I ask you something
6/23/19, 2:35 AM - Shona 😍: I'm just remembering things from before
6/23/19, 2:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am asking you a direct question
6/23/19, 2:35 AM - Shona 😍: And that makes me compare it
6/23/19, 2:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is a direct answer to it
6/23/19, 2:37 AM - Shona 😍: Sometimes it is difficult to talk to you. I don't know what that is about.
6/23/19, 2:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you say a bit more?
6/23/19, 2:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand something is difficult
6/23/19, 2:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is just a kind way of saying you didn't like something
6/23/19, 2:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I am solving it for you and directly asking you
6/23/19, 2:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What you didn't like
6/23/19, 2:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you can stop explaining how it can be or how it could be and just say directly what you didn't like.
6/23/19, 2:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know what's the fuss about. Don't you feel comfortable around me enough to let me know what you feel and what you think?
6/23/19, 2:40 AM - Shona 😍: Rn I don't know what it is that I feel
6/23/19, 2:40 AM - Shona 😍: I feel distant
6/23/19, 2:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it me spending time with someone else?
6/23/19, 2:40 AM - Shona 😍: I feel sad because we have talked so little
6/23/19, 2:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona, I think I feel it too but everytime I do, I am been told by you that it's only 11 days.
6/23/19, 2:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yes, it's only 11 days.
6/23/19, 2:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So don't worry
6/23/19, 2:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: By Friday you will have your results
6/23/19, 2:42 AM - Shona 😍: It's like I don't know what's been going on with you
6/23/19, 2:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And next week after that you will be here
6/23/19, 2:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
6/23/19, 2:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't feel bad
6/23/19, 2:43 AM - Shona 😍: And I'm glad you have good friends in your life, I really am! This time it just reminded me of that I'm not there, and I only heard about those things much later
6/23/19, 2:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also it's a proven research that people feel bad on their retreats from their vacations
6/23/19, 2:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean they feel more sad than usual
6/23/19, 2:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I tried calling you the first thing, after I got my cheque. That was the moment of joy I wanted to share with you but you messaged after 3 hours.
6/23/19, 2:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yes, I hate it too
6/23/19, 2:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you know what
6/23/19, 2:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When you will be here.
6/23/19, 2:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Those people, the very same friends, will starve for me. Because all my time will be yours. It's sad, the distance and the fact that you were the last to know but what can we do about it. Seriously, maybe we can talk regularly and almost like a rule.but don't you think that for now, the situation will fix itself once we meet?
6/23/19, 2:48 AM - Shona 😍: Well it will certainly be better when we meet. I just want to avoid the mentality that communication before that is not important because it is
6/23/19, 2:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously, you were the first person I called. Even before mom. I wanted to cry with you. I wanted to tell you about the presentation and everything but you didn't pick up
6/23/19, 2:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: True
6/23/19, 2:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But if that is the case then you will have to find a balance.
6/23/19, 2:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will have to excuse yourself and shell out time for us.
6/23/19, 2:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Even if it is at the cost of family time or friends time.
6/23/19, 2:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Same goes for me.
6/23/19, 2:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I also didn't get this one thing, if you were with Benita's family, why didn't you reply to my messages?
6/23/19, 2:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I called and messaged
6/23/19, 2:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both
6/23/19, 2:51 AM - Shona 😍: And that's so sad! I would've wanted to be there for that! I didn't even hear my phone and we were meeting the parents for the first time and at the same time for the last time before the wedding in December so I wasn't even checking my phone as it was an important meeting
6/23/19, 2:52 AM - Shona 😍: True
6/23/19, 2:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's the thing, I understand that it was important but you should have kept the phone with you. Seriously, you have to learn to do that.  Phones are supposed to possess the ability to connect us for such ad-hoc calls. I think instead of trying to understand what they were saying, and showing your support, it was ok to excuse yourself for 5
6/23/19, 2:54 AM - Shona 😍: Yes, that is something for me to learn
6/23/19, 2:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And there is no one to blame but you. You have done that in the past as well. You don't seem to understand how I am also an integral part of your life that others related to you have to understand. But you cave in yourself and then this distance happens then you feel left out but you forget that you are the one who made the decision of focusing elsewhere in the first place. Maybe I am painting the picture too negatively but you seriously do that.
6/23/19, 2:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you can't take a call in such a meeting how will you take a stand for me when I come to Finland and have to crash at your parents' for the weekend. Because I am sure Mikko could have arranged for Benita but I was wondering if you'll ever do that for me.
6/23/19, 2:57 AM - Shona 😍: Oh actually I just remembered, you didn't call, you just messaged. Maybe I would've heard the call
6/23/19, 2:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh  I am sorry then, my fault.
6/23/19, 3:01 AM - Shona 😍: You make it sound like I'm the only one who's been busy, you've been too. And there's the time difference too, you sleep way earlier usually. I admit I have been busy, usually in the evenings. It's very unfortunate that this happened during that one day when we were at the parents'
6/23/19, 3:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are right I am sorry
6/23/19, 3:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is exactly what I meant but this is not a blame game.
6/23/19, 3:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But yeah whatever whoever, both suffer
6/23/19, 3:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So rules and habits will help survive this crash. I think that will do.
6/23/19, 3:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You tell me if you agree.
6/23/19, 3:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know you are pissed
6/23/19, 3:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night. I am very sleepy. My eyes wont open. I haven't slept in an entire week properly
6/23/19, 3:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry
6/23/19, 3:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
6/23/19, 3:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can type whatever you want to say.
6/23/19, 3:06 AM - Shona 😍: Ok go sleep
6/23/19, 3:06 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
6/23/19, 3:06 AM - Shona 😍: Perhaps that's the best way
6/23/19, 3:21 AM - Shona 😍: Also, you're not even telling your mother that I'm coming to India, let alone that we're together, and you're saying something like that? Of course I would ask if they could do that. But you wouldn't do the same for me, so I can understand that maybe my parents are also wondering how serious you can be with me, if you're not even telling your parents about us. I get that there are cultural differences but it works both ways, it's not easy for my parents either.
6/23/19, 3:46 AM - Shona 😍: And that is also something I don't particularly appreciate, that you're not telling your family about me. Maybe along the same lines of what Faizal said about staying true to your rebellious character. You're not applying it here either?
6/23/19, 3:51 AM - Shona 😍: I mean that's not the reason why I don't like it myself but it does seem like another thing that's not quite right about the status quo
6/23/19, 10:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
6/23/19, 10:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just whenever you wake up
6/23/19, 10:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Text me
6/23/19, 10:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean can we speak on call?
6/23/19, 2:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you feel any less distant?
6/23/19, 2:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: After th call?
6/23/19, 2:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *the
6/23/19, 2:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What happened to the ViSA
6/23/19, 2:52 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah. I also remembered that this is the first time I have to think how I feel about such things, like how important it is for me to meet your parents, and how does it even feel to meet your partner's parents. I don't have any reference points from my own experience. And that's a main reason why I don't have the answers ready and why they need to be discussed. About this particular matter we had talked about before, but then I guess when I hear other perspectives (like about Laura and Fasu) it makes me think again. And maybe spending so much time with my family these past days makes me think about their opinions more.
6/23/19, 2:53 PM - Shona 😍: Haven't got any response yet 😳
6/23/19, 2:55 PM - Shona 😍: It was supposed to be 3-4 days if you take it there personally. But since I left it to the mailbox I'm starting to think they deal with it like other applications that they receive over mail, and that takes 3-4 _weeks_ 🙄
6/23/19, 2:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will you be able to get it in time?
6/23/19, 2:55 PM - Shona 😍: I should
6/23/19, 2:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you call them?
6/23/19, 2:56 PM - Shona 😍: Then there's even an option for an expedited one
6/23/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: I don't have the application number with me on the trip, it's only on my laptop
6/23/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: Dumb of me
6/23/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: So I can check when we get home
6/23/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: If all else fails
6/23/19, 4:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
6/23/19, 7:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby?
6/23/19, 7:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Feeling like talking to your darling?
6/23/19, 7:25 PM - Shona 😍: Sure
6/23/19, 7:25 PM - Shona 😍: Should we make plans for July?
6/23/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was just thinking about it
6/23/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also
6/23/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I introspected and realized that i have been an ass and have not talked to you much in the recent past
6/23/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So..
6/23/19, 7:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
6/23/19, 7:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yes we can. And we should
6/23/19, 7:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How have you been?
6/23/19, 7:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How was your day?
6/23/19, 7:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you traveling?
6/23/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: It's okay
6/23/19, 7:36 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
6/23/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: 100km left to the next camping sign
6/23/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: Site
6/23/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: Hehe
6/23/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: I've been navigating
6/23/19, 7:37 PM - Shona 😍: I've been reading Nudge
6/23/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is so nice
6/23/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh?
6/23/19, 7:38 PM - Shona 😍: Not much
6/23/19, 7:38 PM - Shona 😍: I mean I haven't done it a lot
6/23/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So will you nudge me a lot when you come here? Hihi🤭
6/23/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not for you but Annika
6/23/19, 7:38 PM - Shona 😍: Oh I will
6/23/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh god😅
6/23/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should I be worried?
6/23/19, 7:39 PM - Shona 😍: Dad is driving
6/23/19, 7:39 PM - Shona 😍: My brain feels like porridge
6/23/19, 7:39 PM - Shona 😍: I had a beer for lunch 🤭
6/23/19, 7:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why baby
6/23/19, 7:39 PM - Shona 😍: Also some chips
6/23/19, 7:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😍
6/23/19, 7:40 PM - Shona 😍: Not the first day I do that on the trip
6/23/19, 7:40 PM - Shona 😍: It's nice though
6/23/19, 7:40 PM - Shona 😍: They have great beer here
6/23/19, 7:42 PM - Shona 😍: So your internship ends on the 12th?
6/23/19, 7:42 PM - Shona 😍: Do you know about the placement preparation yet? Like how much you want to be doing that?
6/23/19, 7:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 6 hours a day will be enough
6/23/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sitting next to you and studying
6/23/19, 7:43 PM - Shona 😍: But you're gonna take breaks?
6/23/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: God do I miss that
6/23/19, 7:43 PM - Shona 😍: And is that every day?
6/23/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will do it exactly how you used to it. Just not that strict
6/23/19, 7:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Occasional kisses and making out and having fun
6/23/19, 7:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will speak to my HR about the extension
6/23/19, 7:44 PM - Shona 😍: Extension?
6/23/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. I was thinking of one. It's good money. I can benefit from a few extra bucks. But before I do. I will have to think it through
6/23/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And most importantly
6/23/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You get to decide
6/23/19, 7:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you want me to be all by your side then that's how it will be.
6/23/19, 7:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Whenever you vanish in the middle of such conversations
6/23/19, 7:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My heart skips a beat
6/23/19, 7:48 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
6/23/19, 7:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always feel like are you mad at me or something
6/23/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not. I am texting alongside with someone. I can stop
6/23/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am totally yours now.
6/23/19, 7:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And also you seem very exhausted?
6/23/19, 7:50 PM - Shona 😍: That's what I meant
6/23/19, 7:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok I am bid good bye to them
6/23/19, 7:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am all yours now
6/23/19, 7:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry
6/23/19, 7:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a confession to make
6/23/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: How long would that be for?
6/23/19, 7:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't even know if that's an option so I don't know yet
6/23/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah?
6/23/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: Obviously that's not true
6/23/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
6/23/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry
6/23/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Form
6/23/19, 7:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *?

6/23/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: I can docus

6/23/19, 7:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
6/23/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: What have you done?
6/23/19, 7:56 PM - Shona 😍: Sure. Sitting all day makes me sluggish
6/23/19, 7:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have been texting with others while talking to you for a while now and it is the same time when we started feeling distanced and I feel talking to others is really harming us because I am not putting that much effort in our conversations as I used to.
6/23/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Soooo
6/23/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am so sorry
6/23/19, 7:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please forgive me

6/23/19, 7:57 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know
6/23/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Excuse me?
6/23/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: Apparently I can't say anything that I feel
6/23/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: I'm such a door mat and I hate it
6/23/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: With my family
6/23/19, 7:58 PM - Shona 😍: With everyone
6/23/19, 7:59 PM - Shona 😍: I'm disgusted rn
6/23/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona, my dear shona. Please listen to me and listen to me very carefully. I will not let you take the beating. Please. I cant let you spoil what we have bulit in the past six months. You are not a door mat. You are a perfectly fine person who in the past six months has enlightened both our lives.
6/23/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are not at fault here
6/23/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: and lets just say even if you are. Lets. Then do you really think I will let you take the beating for it?
6/23/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you really think I will let you feel lost?
6/23/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wont baby
6/23/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: I know! But what the fuck is wrong with me that I don't even say anything
6/23/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wont
6/23/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Its not easy for everyone
6/23/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you think I say everything?
6/23/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am gonna assume its a yes
6/23/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: No
6/23/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: You don't
6/23/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes! Exactly! I dont
6/23/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: even for me
6/23/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: it is difficult sometimes
6/23/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: but let me tell you something els
6/23/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *else
6/23/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not going to let you sink into that
6/23/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will always and necessarily always
6/23/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Remind you
6/23/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: when you get lost
6/23/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: when you feel hazy
6/23/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am not going to give up on us
6/23/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: please, I am not
6/23/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: soo... do you want to listen to an exercise that we can do so that you can change this habit?
6/23/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: No
6/23/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: you dont want to?
6/23/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: No
6/23/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: I'm in a very bad mood rn
6/23/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ok
6/23/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
6/23/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: Disappointed with myself
6/23/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But but but
6/23/19, 8:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I please tell you something?
6/23/19, 8:08 PM - Shona 😍: No
6/23/19, 8:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/23/19, 8:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: please
6/23/19, 8:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: allow me
6/23/19, 8:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I may have something to say
6/23/19, 8:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or we can video call if you want to
6/23/19, 8:17 PM - Shona 😍: I don't want to hear it right now
6/23/19, 8:20 PM - Shona 😍: But what is wrong is that I know that something's wrong but I'm not saying it. I don't like something and I won't say it. People will walk over me. I might still be thinking about a polite way of saying it but then we already move on to the next topic or something and I end up saying nothing
6/23/19, 8:20 PM - Shona 😍: And that's a huge problem. That's how I will end up bitter
6/23/19, 8:21 PM - Shona 😍: Feeling helpless
6/23/19, 8:21 PM - Shona 😍: When I don't need to be
6/23/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey! Shut up! You will not! I won't let you
6/23/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes! And you will never be help"less"
6/23/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will always be there by your side.
6/23/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No matter how you feel or how you are.
6/23/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bitter or sweet
6/23/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: Well you have good intentions
6/23/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Helpless or not
6/23/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: But you don't always do it
6/23/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I try
6/23/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I faulter too
6/23/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: And no one can do it entirely for another person
6/23/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: Exactly
6/23/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can try. But seriously, I can think of something that we can try which can fix things for you.
6/23/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's no way of living life. Everyone's got to breathe.
6/23/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But my advice to you is that don't push me away. It's already very hard for me to think on both our parts and fix it and keep it balanced. Don't push me further. I will break.
6/23/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: Me too. I had plans before I met you, like I've told you. But then I started to focus on other things, and the other things were good in their own way. But now this seems to be turning into a problem with us too, occasionally
6/23/19, 8:26 PM - Shona 😍: That was in response to this
6/23/19, 8:27 PM - Shona 😍: That's the thing. You shouldn't be the one fixing everything
6/23/19, 8:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You had plans for fixing the doormat problem? And what is the "this" in the this seems to be turning...
6/23/19, 8:28 PM - Shona 😍: Yes, and "this" refers to the same thing, being a doormat
6/23/19, 8:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I try and accommodate your feelings as much as I can 😓
6/23/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: I know!
6/23/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry that it's not enough
6/23/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am such an ass. I can't empathize with my own beloved
6/23/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: I'm the one who should be more assertive
6/23/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: That's not true
6/23/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On that front
6/23/19, 8:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can I ask you something?
6/23/19, 8:31 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
6/23/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel you are not being assertive about it
6/23/19, 8:31 PM - Shona 😍: ?
6/23/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want me to stop being friends with Vandana
6/23/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I know it bothers yiu
6/23/19, 8:31 PM - Shona 😍: Why?
6/23/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *you
6/23/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or I have a feeling it does.
6/23/19, 8:36 PM - Shona 😍: I trust you. And I'm not gonna let my jealousy get between your friendships! I mean of course I'm jealous, ahe gets to spend time with you in person, and I have to talk to you through the phone and only see you on my small screen! That's beyond awful, I don't even have words for it. Okay maybe also in the past days I don't like it that you haven't even talked to me properly but have been spending so much time with her. On the other hand, I've been busy too and not being able to be on call that much. So overall it's been a shitty situation.
6/23/19, 8:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to meet my father when you come here?
6/23/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a very risky proposal
6/23/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I feel I can make it happen
6/23/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you really want it
6/23/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: Why are you making it?
6/23/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: In this moment
6/23/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I feel it means something to you. I may not understand it and I don't want it to be a gridlock. I may not understand it but that doesn't mean it shouldn't happen for you
6/23/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My happiness resides in yours
6/23/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if thats what you want
6/23/19, 8:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then
6/23/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: How do you think your father would take it?
6/23/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have no idea
6/23/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😖
6/23/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: Wouldn't he also tell your mum?
6/23/19, 8:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I can stop that from happening
6/23/19, 8:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: By making him swear or something
6/23/19, 8:44 PM - Shona 😍: It would mean the world to me to meet anyone from your family. But I don't want you to be uncomfortable with it
6/23/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At this point I don't care.
6/23/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If it is that important to you
6/23/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then that's how it will jem
6/23/19, 8:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *be
6/23/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to say
6/23/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: But I'm smiling
6/23/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Glad you said that
6/23/19, 8:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because having read just that
6/23/19, 8:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would have probably torn my hair or something.  God! What does she want 😅
6/23/19, 8:48 PM - Shona 😍: Leave your hair alone please 😅
6/23/19, 8:49 PM - Shona 😍: Okay but let's not make a hasty decision about this
6/23/19, 8:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am glad that my roomie attempts at least made you smile
6/23/19, 8:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry Shona that I make your life miserable
6/23/19, 8:52 PM - Shona 😍: You gotta stop that
6/23/19, 8:52 PM - Shona 😍: Saying that I mean
6/23/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How come I have to make all the ammends
6/23/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not
6/23/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Huh
6/23/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😄😄
6/23/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am kidding
6/23/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
6/23/19, 8:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will try
6/23/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I just pray that let not there be a day when I make you more miserable than happy
6/23/19, 8:57 PM - Shona 😍: Ok we're getting close to the camp site
6/23/19, 8:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok?
6/23/19, 8:58 PM - Shona 😍: Means I might need to navigate soon
6/23/19, 9:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh ok
6/23/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did my Shona reach?
6/23/19, 9:43 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah. We're gonna have dinner now
6/23/19, 9:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you don't have me there, what will you eat?
6/23/19, 9:43 PM - Shona 😍: Good question
6/23/19, 10:55 PM - Shona 😍: That was the best Italian food I've had in long while 😍
6/23/19, 10:56 PM - Shona 😍: And the best ice cream
6/23/19, 10:56 PM - Shona 😍: Seriously
6/23/19, 10:56 PM - Shona 😍: You gotta try Italian ice cream
6/23/19, 11:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bring some for me
6/23/19, 11:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also
6/23/19, 11:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A question
6/23/19, 11:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Were you hangry?
6/23/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: I wish I could
6/23/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Earlier?
6/23/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: I wasn't even very hungry
6/23/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: I was just grumpy
6/23/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: I think from sitting on my ass all day
6/23/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: And 24/7 with my family..
6/23/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: And then I still felt distant
6/23/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: In the beginning
6/23/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: Didn't know exactly why
6/23/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In the beginning of?
6/23/19, 11:15 PM - Shona 😍: The conversation
6/23/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well  baby. At this point I am desperately trying to find a reason but I am running out of tricks up my sleeve
6/23/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or solutions
6/23/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I can feel you
6/23/19, 11:16 PM - Shona 😍: I think it was because we hadn't talked. It almost always seems to be that
6/23/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am feeling so helpless as to what I can do
6/23/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: I think it will be easier after I get there. It's been a really long time
6/23/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: Since December
6/23/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's what Faiz said
6/23/19, 11:18 PM - Shona 😍: Yes. Let's be patient
6/23/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How can we fix that baby?
6/23/19, 11:18 PM - Shona 😍: 10 more days
6/23/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you want to talk rn?
6/23/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😱😱😱😱😱
6/23/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😍😍😍😍♥♥♥
6/23/19, 11:18 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
6/23/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow this is first time that my smiling face didn't make your smile.
6/23/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *you
6/23/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Video call?
6/23/19, 11:19 PM - Shona 😍: Nope
6/23/19, 11:19 PM - Shona 😍: There have been times before
6/23/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂
6/23/19, 11:19 PM - Shona 😍: Please
6/24/19, 12:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
6/24/19, 12:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Simply said.
6/24/19, 12:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I told you in the very beginning of our relationship that I won't be able to tell my mother.
6/24/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About this relationship
6/24/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then you said you didn't like the idea, almost after 9 months
6/24/19, 12:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You said it because you felt closer to your family and that you wanted to meet my mother.
6/24/19, 1:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then I felt like I am in this race alone. I mean there is no such thing as love and couples and our love and I am fighting my own battle. How I have to face my mother on my own and then convince you that it is working. Meanwhile you will have your parents and my mother will loose her calm so I will have to console her. Console you and everyone but who will take care of me. A journey in which we started together a battle which we had to conquer together, and comfort each other in need, I felt like that you abandoned me in the middle of nowhere, asking me to fix a situation that will test me completely. You won't stand by me until I fix it and I am on my own on all fronts and I have no one for me.
6/24/19, 1:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That to me was very disheartening
6/24/19, 1:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As how quickly you still are able to distinguish ourselves apart. Like I am a third party either trying to harm you or something
6/24/19, 1:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night.
6/24/19, 1:08 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
6/24/19, 1:10 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
6/24/19, 1:47 AM - Shona 😍: Good night

6/24/19, 8:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A very very good morning
6/24/19, 8:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: May you have a great week ahead
6/24/19, 12:40 PM - Shona 😍: Good morning shona
6/24/19, 12:41 PM - Shona 😍: You too 🤗
6/24/19, 1:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I live you baby

6/24/19, 1:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙂😍♥
6/24/19, 1:47 PM - Shona 😍: You are silly 🤭❤
6/24/19, 3:49 PM - Shona 😍: What's the difference between nahi and na?
6/24/19, 3:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nahi is just more formal
6/24/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😍
6/24/19, 3:50 PM - Shona 😍: Ahh
6/24/19, 3:50 PM - Shona 😍: Ok

6/24/19, 3:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd swirl
6/24/19, 3:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I wish it was raining
6/24/19, 3:55 PM - Shona 😍: 😍🙈
6/24/19, 3:57 PM - Shona 😍: Someone really liked the Batman t-shirt yesterday 😄
6/24/19, 3:57 PM - Shona 😍: It was a man with a small child wrapped to his chest
6/24/19, 3:57 PM - Shona 😍: At the camping site
6/24/19, 3:57 PM - Shona 😍: First he just smiled at me widely and said hi
6/24/19, 3:58 PM - Shona 😍: Then he started speaking German
6/24/19, 3:58 PM - Shona 😍: And pointed at my chest
6/24/19, 3:58 PM - Shona 😍: Fisrt I was like whaaaa
6/24/19, 3:58 PM - Shona 😍: But then I realized

6/25/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: I hope there is
6/25/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: On Wednesday morning we'll reach Helsinki
6/25/19, 12:42 AM - Shona 😍: I will write to you
6/25/19, 3:59 AM - Shona 😍: Mera Shona. I miss you. I realize I've been quite unavailable too, or at least not very active in initiating conversations. The traveling is tricky in the sense that there are no routines and every day is different.
Tonight we spent the evening in Lubeck, and that pic I sent earlier was from a restaurant there. The ship leaves from Travemunde at 3am. (Oh and Lubeck and Travemunde are cities in the Northern Germany). Luckily we can at least board the ship around 12. It's nice to finally spend the night somewhere else than the camper, even though the camper is very cozy. 
I checked the results from the exam for the first time today. They were not ready yet, and I wasn't surprised. I will check again tomorrow, if we have the wifi.
I'm glad we had time to shop today as well, because as I told you, cosmetics are sooooo much cheaper here. So I just bought a lot of the stuff I use regularly and that saved me quite a lot of money. Also I got one more pair of shoes, sneakers this time, and they were only 23e. The shoes are literally half the price of what we pay in Finland. I didn't buy clothes, because I know that those I can buy from India. Shoes are more uncertain so I just wanted to play it safe with them. I'm seriously looking forward to shopping there with you! I've started to like shopping again. I think it has to do with me getting more comfortable with myself. And the fact that I've lost weight so that I'm pretty much the same size now than I was when I graduated from upper secondary. This morning I freaked out a bit though. I hadn't seen myself in the mirror without clothes in a while, but at this camping site they had mirrors in the shower rooms. I hadn't realized that I look that thin, compared to earlier this year. I like being like this again though. It feels like I'm myself again. Or maybe not. I was myself all this time. This is just more familiar to me. And I do feel more attractive now. And lighter, moving and staying active is easier. Okay enough about that. 
What else. I still can't believe I'm coming there and that I'm gonna actually see you in person again in 8(!!!) days. 
About sex. As I said I didn't really like what you said yesterday. The way you put it made it sound like a laborious exercise and it felt like it needs to be some kind of performance. It made the thought of sex stressful and not fun. And to me that's like the worst thing, why would I then even want to do it at all. I have been thinking about stuff on my own, when I've been masturbating for example. Of course it's completely different in reality then, and as we know I haven't done much anything before. Other than what we did last year. 
That wasn't stressful at all, though I was still shy. And because you hadn't taken the tests yet, I couldn't do all that I would have wanted to do. On the other hand the pace seemed good back then. Maybe it would've been too much for me if we'd done more. Or then not. There's no way to know that. What I'd like for the upcoming days is that you remember that it's all new to me. And I believe it will be great, like it was the last time. I believe it will be much better actually. Though maybe in the beginning it's not that great. I remember our first kiss and I really didn't like that at all. It felt like way too much. But quite fast it got much better and it started to feel really good.
Also. I have the appointment for the IUD on 2nd of July. They said it's effective one week after the placing. So before that, condoms will be necessary. Could you get them, and also could you get some nice lube? Hmm and yesterday you suggested we stop masturbating soon. Maybe it's a good idea. But it's been over a week for me without much any of that, so I might want to do something to myself after we get home. I mean I'm gonna want to. But maybe a week before I can stop. On the other hand, I feel like I still figure out new things about what I find hot when I masturbate so maybe it's also useful in that sense to do it. 
What else. I'm getting really sleepy... We're still waiting for the boarding at the harbor. This has been a funny trip. We've traveled through seven countries in 9 days. Huhhuh. It feels like we haven't done much anything except for sitting in the car, eating and sleeping. Yeah we spent two whole days in Austria with Mikko and Benita and did some shopping on some days. But the majority of the time we've spent in the camper. I've done some reading, mostly I've read Nudge. Then I've just been staring at the changing landscapes while we've been driving. I've read some travel blogs about India. I've been frustrated about not being able to plan the important things in life and I've been focusing on more superficial things. I've been thinking about clothes and hair and shoes and makeup... One night I did some serious thinking though. It was the night on which you refused to talk with me. I paced through the small yard of the camping site where we were staying that time. I walked back and forth next to a small pond and thought. I thought about what I will do if I don't make it to med school. I thought about what I will do if we can't figure our differences out and can't stay together. I actually thought about Jordan Peterson's advices, and thought that I will listen to them. I thought I will go back to studying theology, if I don't make it to med school this time. If that happens though, I'm gonna need several evenings (actually days) like that more. Okay but I'm not gonna think about it more now before I get the results. 
About the landscapes. Europe is really very beautiful. This was only some of the Eastern and Central part, but it was seriously pretty. Lot of fields with different flowers and grains, forests, hills, mountains and valleys. In the Baltic it was very similar to Finland, but already in Poland you could see the difference better. I will show you more pics, I'm gonna ask everyone to share the ones they took too. My phone wasn't that good with taking pics through the window, I hope others got better shots. 
About Mikko and Benita. Their apartment is soooooo nice! And seeing it and hearing Benita talk about ordinary stuff like doing laundry, applying for jobs, cooking... It made me crave for a place of my own. Getting a place of _our_ own seems so far away I didn't even dare to dream about it yet. Okay I wouldn't want only a place for me. But I crave for a place where I get to decide about the furniture, what I cook, when I do laundry, when I clean, what do I get from the grocery store... All very ordinary stuff. And I do realize that's all work too, and I have it easier when I live with my parents. But I crave for the independence and being responsible for all of that on my own. Being a grown-up. I had a taste of that during the year I lived in Helsinki on my own. It had its upsides and downsides. But what I do know is that I'm more mature now and I would handle it better. And I have you. And that's the most important thing. I don't know what I would do without you Shona. I have learnt so much from you and from being with you. Something that I've been thinking many times these past days is the shift in my thinking in relation to taking care of things and my own abilities. That I can get things done if I want to. I'm not helpless. And I realize that I've got rid of a lot of negativity in the past year. I used to spend a lot of time just feeling miserable and helpless because it felt like I couldn't change anything about my life. Like I was stuck and someone else always decided how things go for me and I have no say in it. I didn't take any action to change things because I didn't believe I could change anything. That's different now. I know I can change things, even if the change is slow. I can. And I am not helpless. And there are probably still gonna be days (like yesterday) when I'm disappointed with myself for not  speaking up or being proactive. And not just that I'm disappointed with myself but that there will be days when I'm not being those things. I just want to keep going in the right direction and then doing better the next days.

6/27/19, 12:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how I would like to be drenched with you
6/27/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How your fingers will glisten with sweat between mine
6/27/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: While we will cry in each others arms
6/27/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At our most vulnerable

6/27/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: I can't change the flights anymore
6/27/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: But I could skip the return flight
6/27/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: And get another
6/27/19, 12:34 AM - Shona 😍: I think
6/27/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: They said I should get a 12 month visa
6/27/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: So I could stay longer than one month
6/27/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: And I don't think they asked the return date
6/27/19, 12:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If we book now we can get the solo return flight for 300
6/27/19, 12:36 AM - Shona 😍: I'll look into it
6/27/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That can be easily existended
6/27/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *extended
6/27/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't worry
6/27/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In India I will make it happen
6/27/19, 12:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Probably cheaper 😛
6/27/19, 12:37 AM - Shona 😍: 😬
6/27/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona
6/27/19, 12:38 AM - Shona 😍: Darling
6/27/19, 12:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometimes I wonder
6/27/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To myself
6/27/19, 12:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How the pink of your nails when seen from the sides with a hint of white
6/27/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the pink of your nose when seen from the side under the yellow light of your room on your bed with your back towards the lamp
6/27/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How the color of these two pinks are alike
6/27/19, 12:41 AM - Shona 😍: 😄
6/27/19, 12:42 AM - Shona 😍: Soon you will get to see both in the light of the Indian sun
6/27/19, 12:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or may be the yellow light
6/27/19, 12:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In our room
6/27/19, 12:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On our bed
6/27/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That we will have
6/27/19, 12:45 AM - Shona 😍: That too❤
6/27/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In which we will lay
6/27/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In each other's arms
6/27/19, 12:45 AM - Shona 😍: Only a week shona
6/27/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh my God the nap
6/27/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The last evening
6/27/19, 12:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What was that
6/27/19, 12:46 AM - Shona 😍: 😄
6/27/19, 12:46 AM - Shona 😍: That was a very special nap
6/27/19, 12:46 AM - Shona 😍: I hope we'll have more of such naps
6/27/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a question for you
6/27/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why would you think
6/27/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A girl from Finland and a boy from mine would fall in love
6/27/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why?
6/27/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking about it
6/27/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I somehow occurred to me
6/27/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That they ultimately have no reason
6/27/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hear me out
6/27/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They dont
6/27/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd the only ways such a thing that happens is
6/27/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That something more basic more primal and more carnal is the reason for it
6/27/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You see if your were make a core you would start from a ball
6/27/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And paint cores on it
6/27/19, 12:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then the inner layers will be shielded by outer ones
6/27/19, 12:54 AM - Shona 😍: Go on?
6/27/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Similarily may be there could be a more stable layer/core of our brain flux
6/27/19, 12:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And those are made in the more less cryptic languages of communication
6/27/19, 12:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That somehow are the inner more fundamental more stable more strengthened brain+inner cores that contain a simpler programming language to communicate to solve more basic carnal unconscious needs and conversations that happen by the channels of Aura and energy
6/27/19, 12:59 AM - Shona 😍: Interesting theory
6/27/19, 12:59 AM - Shona 😍: What exactly do you mean by Aura and energy?
6/27/19, 1:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Everything communicates only in waves
6/27/19, 1:07 AM - Shona 😍: What kind of waves?
6/27/19, 1:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You talk
6/27/19, 1:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In saying
6/27/19, 1:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You produce sound
6/27/19, 1:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Waves
6/27/19, 1:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Body cues? A way of communication?
6/27/19, 1:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How do you communicate?
6/27/19, 1:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You communicate in the form of light
6/27/19, 1:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Waves
6/27/19, 1:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You communicate by touching?
6/27/19, 1:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Touching is sensation
6/27/19, 1:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sensation is transmission of nerve impulses producing a perception of touch
6/27/19, 1:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This impulse is electric
6/27/19, 1:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Electricity is wave
6/27/19, 1:12 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
6/27/19, 1:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So everything is wave
6/27/19, 1:12 AM - Shona 😍: How about particles
6/27/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/27/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/27/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
6/27/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: And wave-particle duality
6/27/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
6/27/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exactly!
6/27/19, 1:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ladies and Gentlemen.  MY lady her! ! 😎
6/27/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So waves right?
6/27/19, 1:14 AM - Shona 😍: Mmmhmmmh
6/27/19, 1:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And waves is energy
6/27/19, 1:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
6/27/19, 1:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Energy and it is waves and then so are the communications that are a part of waves
6/27/19, 1:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And aura is energy
6/27/19, 1:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So we communicate in energy in the more basic programming languages that offer a less complicated answers to the more basic needs of our unconscious that are realized by communicating to the other unconsiouses of other people and this communication is done in form of energy and it's communication in a more basic programming language that is used to communicate between these unconsciouses. You see what I am saying..
6/27/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmmm
6/27/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: Fascinating
6/27/19, 1:24 AM - Shona 😍: So do you think everybody communicates like that?
6/27/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes we all do
6/27/19, 1:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why do you think you like guitar?
6/27/19, 1:25 AM - Shona 😍: I like the sounds it makes
6/27/19, 1:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why do you like it?
6/27/19, 1:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean how do you like it?
6/27/19, 1:26 AM - Shona 😍: Something in my brain finds it pleasurable to listen to
6/27/19, 1:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I sometimes like the sound because the individual tone after tone gives me a feature in mind and then I see every such tone as a story and then these stories create another grand story which is just a walk down the memory lane and then each song is just a string of feature based memories links
6/27/19, 1:29 AM - Shona 😍: Do you experience or consciously realize that while listening to some song?
6/27/19, 1:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ya. Sometimes I do
6/27/19, 1:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I have had that when I am slow
6/27/19, 1:31 AM - Shona 😍: When you're slow?
6/27/19, 1:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Weed slow
6/27/19, 1:31 AM - Shona 😍: Ahhh
6/27/19, 1:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry I presumed you'd figure😅
6/27/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I feel weed gives us a glimpse into our basic memory management hard drives stored in the internal cores of your brain flux. Weed shows how we are in good hands with their highly effecient( in terms of catche ) and then that faith in a higher superpower at work makes us feel relaxed. So it is their way of expressing
6/27/19, 1:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In terms of memory lines
6/27/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
6/27/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
6/27/19, 1:38 AM - Shona 😍: Baby, your grammar has been getting a bit difficult to understand
6/27/19, 1:38 AM - Shona 😍: You must be really sleepy?
6/27/19, 1:38 AM - Shona 😍: And you're sleep deprived overall
6/27/19, 1:39 AM - Shona 😍: I think I got it what you meant by that though
6/27/19, 1:39 AM - Shona 😍: Except for the last sentence
6/27/19, 1:39 AM - Shona 😍: And this
6/27/19, 1:39 AM - Shona 😍: Whose way of expressing?
6/27/19, 1:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One unconscious to the other unconscious
6/27/19, 1:42 AM - Shona 😍: Okay I'm not following anymore
6/27/19, 1:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Bored?
6/27/19, 1:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
6/27/19, 1:42 AM - Shona 😍: What does that have to do with weed and memory?
6/27/19, 1:43 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you interested or mad?
6/27/19, 1:44 AM - Shona 😍: I'm not mad, I'm just seriously confused
6/27/19, 1:44 AM - Shona 😍: It's getting very difficult to make sense of what you're saying
6/27/19, 1:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry
6/27/19, 1:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let it be
6/27/19, 1:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's talk tomorrow?
6/27/19, 1:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
6/27/19, 1:45 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
6/27/19, 1:45 AM - Shona 😍: You can explain it in person
6/27/19, 1:45 AM - Shona 😍: Good night darling shona
6/27/19, 1:46 AM - Shona 😍: Also
6/27/19, 1:47 AM - Shona 😍: Still like the vast majority of times
6/27/19, 1:47 AM - Shona 😍: When you think I'm mad
6/27/19, 1:47 AM - Shona 😍: I'm really not
6/27/19, 1:49 AM - Shona 😍: And I'm starting to get a bit concerned that you're not sleeping enough
6/27/19, 1:51 AM - Shona 😍: Babu?
6/27/19, 1:51 AM - Shona 😍: What are you thinking?
6/27/19, 2:00 AM - Shona 😍: I'm guessing you slept 😬
6/27/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yup
6/27/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes?
6/27/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have it in my mind
6/27/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I will say more in person
6/27/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it will be like our first meeting
6/27/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: An abstract conversation
6/27/19, 9:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
6/27/19, 9:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love yoy

6/27/19, 11:43 AM - Shona 😍: I can't believe I'm a med student now
6/27/19, 11:43 AM - Shona 😍: Also
6/27/19, 11:44 AM - Shona 😍: All the best for the presentation

6/27/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh yes!
6/27/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I forgot about that
6/27/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: She told me something about Kuopio!
6/27/19, 11:21 PM - Shona 😍: She studies there herself!
6/27/19, 11:22 PM - Shona 😍: And she said if I have anything more I want to know I can just ask her
6/27/19, 11:22 PM - Shona 😍: Then I need to decide whether I want to live alone or with a roommate
6/27/19, 11:22 PM - Shona 😍: For the apartment hunting
6/27/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey that's great!
6/27/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What did she say about the college?
6/27/19, 11:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know you can apply for mentorship right!
6/27/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm not much, she told about the city, recommended some areas
6/27/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: What do you mean?
6/27/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: But I found out that of the Finnish med schools, the Kuopio one is most focused on actual clinical training
6/27/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can be a mentor to someone
6/27/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: That seems great
6/27/19, 11:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😍
6/27/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: But also they do great research
6/27/19, 11:27 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmm yeah.. Do you think I would be good at that?
6/27/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will rock it!
6/27/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are such an empathetic person
6/27/19, 11:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And such a focused one
6/27/19, 11:29 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm maybe I should try it out then
6/27/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you know your stuff inside out
6/27/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you don't say anything
6/27/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You think and speak
6/27/19, 11:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. You are also a very a good motivator
6/27/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have this knack of asking just the right questions
6/27/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At the right time
6/27/19, 11:33 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. It would be challenging. Probably in a good way though
6/27/19, 11:33 PM - Shona 😍: I would want to do well if I were to do it
6/27/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to be good in everything. Sometimes it is just about being
6/27/19, 11:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being average is also fine. Maybe someone very extraordinary needs you as just an average person
6/27/19, 11:40 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
6/27/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: I don't want to be crappy at it, that's what I mean 😋
6/27/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh
6/27/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
6/27/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: But this
6/27/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: Is the next important question
6/27/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think alone will be good
6/27/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or I don't think its a question of whether
6/27/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or which
6/27/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think you should only live alone
6/27/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not about the money
6/27/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not about anything
6/27/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: Why?
6/27/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Its about the change in personality that it will bring about
6/27/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that I think should be your only preferences
6/27/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You remember how I keep saying that this exam will change you
6/27/19, 11:52 PM - Shona 😍: Yea
6/27/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now is the time
6/27/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: For?
6/27/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When your life will be in flux
6/27/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now is the time to change habits
6/27/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: But both will develop my personality, living alone or living with a roommate. It's just about the direction
6/27/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To change yourself
6/27/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: True
6/27/19, 11:56 PM - Shona 😍: It will be entirely different anyway, from living with my parents
6/27/19, 11:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
6/27/19, 11:58 PM - Shona 😍: Well, I don't think it's really about the money, I will get support from the government anyway, and I can also take a student loan if needed
6/28/19, 12:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I want to support you
6/28/19, 12:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wouldn't want to differentiate between our money

6/28/19, 5:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know why you are so pessimistic about it
6/28/19, 5:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do you believe we are his children?
6/28/19, 5:46 PM - Shona 😍: I would want to
6/28/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: Often times it's just difficult
6/28/19, 5:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But why
6/28/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: Well so much bad things happens to many other people
6/28/19, 5:48 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think they deserve it

6/28/19, 5:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's for a second believe that we are his children?
6/28/19, 5:49 PM - Shona 😍: Sure
6/28/19, 5:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If we are... Have you seen sometimes children are not able to see that what is good for them
6/28/19, 5:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And for the same the parent has to punish them
6/28/19, 5:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But do you realize
6/28/19, 5:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That every parent when adored their child pat them, kiss them, give them candy, give them blessings, interfere with their flights
6/28/19, 5:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the same parent when sees that punsihment is the thing required then they beat the child.
6/28/19, 5:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And even then that is good
6/28/19, 5:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I believe that tells you that everything happens for good
6/28/19, 5:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We are indeed children with no identity of our ow
6/28/19, 5:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *own
6/28/19, 5:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Our fate is decided by our parents.
6/28/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And we just can rest assure that everything is happening for good.
6/28/19, 5:53 PM - Shona 😍: 😳
6/28/19, 5:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And occasionally thank them when we realize like a baby how we love them by going to the Sunday church and thank them

6/30/19, 12:40 AM - Shona 😍: Okay I thought about it a bit more. I think I got annoyed by what you said, even if I was in the mood for something, I wasn't in the mood for you to demand stuff like that. I'm sorry for how I reacted.
6/30/19, 12:42 AM - Shona 😍: Another thing that's been on my mind is the IUD. It's likely to be hella painful so I'm not exactly thrilled about it. I'm not evn sure if we have appropriate painkillers for that. Hmm another thing I gotta check. Anywhoo. I try not to think about it before the procedure itself.
6/30/19, 12:52 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
6/30/19, 7:54 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
6/30/19, 9:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
6/30/19, 9:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You did not sleep well again?
6/30/19, 10:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh you had a morning shift
6/30/19, 10:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then too
6/30/19, 10:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You slept early
6/30/19, 11:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean you woke up early
6/30/19, 1:43 PM - Shona 😍: Yessss
6/30/19, 1:43 PM - Shona 😍: It's a busy shift
6/30/19, 1:43 PM - Shona 😍: Lot of regular workers away
6/30/19, 1:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
6/30/19, 2:36 PM - Shona 😍: Are you gonna go to Faizal's today?
6/30/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No baby
6/30/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Change of plans
6/30/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: These people needed help
6/30/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With unpacking
6/30/19, 3:22 PM - Shona 😍: Okay? So where are you gonna stay? I thought you had to leave by midnight
6/30/19, 4:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
6/30/19, 4:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am came with these people
6/30/19, 6:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I made a bad decision I must say
6/30/19, 6:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😓
6/30/19, 6:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel very very irritated
6/30/19, 6:35 PM - Shona 😍: Bad decision with what?
6/30/19, 6:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Coming here to help en
6/30/19, 6:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *em
6/30/19, 6:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok your reaction was dramatic but so was the timing of my demand. To me it was surprising because I am the kind of person who has said that being creative comment in the past and also, I may say it in the future as well. But the demand was very ill placed because I can't just place such requests when you are tired/worked up/worried etc etc
6/30/19, 6:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I should have gauged that it's the IUD that is bothering you and so are other things
6/30/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I guess that is what distance means
6/30/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't know what's going on with the other person
6/30/19, 8:23 PM - Shona 😍: Yes!
6/30/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please forgive me.
6/30/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: It's okay
6/30/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: It happens
6/30/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: Though it's been happening a lot lately 🤔
6/30/19, 8:25 PM - Shona 😍: The distance I mean
6/30/19, 8:28 PM - Shona 😍: https://youtu.be/eIVxPRqgtD4
6/30/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: The last one 😂😂
6/30/19, 8:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both of us have had very exhausting past one and a half months
6/30/19, 8:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But seriously I am do disgusted rn
6/30/19, 8:36 PM - Shona 😍: About what exactly
6/30/19, 8:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Being taken for granted
6/30/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: By me? Or your roommates?
6/30/19, 8:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Them
6/30/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why do you think I will think that you are taking me for granted?
6/30/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know
6/30/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: I thought it's the roommates
6/30/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: But we were just talking about the distance btwn us
6/30/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: So
6/30/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: I just made sure
6/30/19, 8:39 PM - Shona 😍: I really hope you don't think I'm taking you for granted
6/30/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sick of the shitty connections
6/30/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: Taking forever for the messages to get through
6/30/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: Not being able to hear you properly on call
6/30/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: So glad that too is gonna change soon
6/30/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
6/30/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am just wondering if it's too late.
6/30/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If the damage done is already irreparable
6/30/19, 9:24 PM - Shona 😍: What damage
6/30/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: It feels that you are being super vague today
6/30/19, 9:25 PM - Shona 😍: I have a hard time understanding anything you say
6/30/19, 9:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just so you know. Not on purpose
6/30/19, 9:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The distance
6/30/19, 9:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The seperation I mean.
6/30/19, 9:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just am afraid if it has been too much
6/30/19, 9:28 PM - Shona 😍: I think if we choose to think so then it can be.
6/30/19, 9:28 PM - Shona 😍: But I also think we can find our way again if we want to
6/30/19, 9:29 PM - Shona 😍: I think it's gonna take some time
6/30/19, 9:29 PM - Shona 😍: Being together in person again
6/30/19, 9:29 PM - Shona 😍: Or then not
6/30/19, 9:29 PM - Shona 😍: Who knows
6/30/19, 9:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. That.
6/30/19, 9:31 PM - Shona 😍: Also I think it's gonna be different also because we have both grown as persons in some ways and a lot has happened
6/30/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: But what has not changed is that I love you
6/30/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: Or actually it has
6/30/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: I love you more now
6/30/19, 10:08 PM - Shona 😍: Do you want to talk tonight?

7/1/19, 9:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not that it's a competition
7/1/19, 9:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
7/1/19, 9:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Isn't that life for you?
7/1/19, 9:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you will have tough phases in which you can't find time for your loved ones but still they understand and they will stick by because they know that you will come around?
7/1/19, 9:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I don't know how I got caught up in your words but just do you know, you will be on my first for many many days to come. And for that to happen, you _had_ to be on My last for a few days.
7/1/19, 9:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I am going crazy over the internship for no reason at all.. but I am really sorry, I don't know how to balance it out. I hope you forgive me and help me improve by pointing it out when I do it.
7/1/19, 9:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please say something
7/1/19, 9:55 AM - Shona 😍: I'm trying my best to calm down
7/1/19, 9:55 AM - Shona 😍: Before I say
7/1/19, 9:57 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe I'm being unreasonable
7/1/19, 9:57 AM - Shona 😍: But oh my god can you be insensitive when you respond

7/1/19, 9:58 AM - Shona 😍: So? That's life
7/1/19, 9:59 AM - Shona 😍: With what I expected, I mean
7/1/19, 10:02 AM - Shona 😍: But one thing is not unreasonable to expect and that's saying good night
7/1/19, 10:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow I thought I had said it 😅
7/1/19, 10:11 AM - Shona 😍: But why do you need to be so harsh?
7/1/19, 10:11 AM - Shona 😍: It made me cry
7/1/19, 10:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😢
7/1/19, 10:12 AM - Shona 😍: And I wanted to say I'm not gonna get the iud tomorrow

7/1/19, 12:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did I do it
7/1/19, 12:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then yeah the brains and the skills I may have had
7/1/19, 12:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But nothing can be done without grit and resilience
7/1/19, 12:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something that you taught me
7/1/19, 12:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something that us have taught me
7/1/19, 12:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if people ask me that why am in such a difficult relationship
7/1/19, 12:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then this is my answer

7/1/19, 12:51 PM - Shona 😍: I'm so glad
7/1/19, 12:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does it?
7/1/19, 12:57 PM - Shona 😍: That the reason you are in this relationship is because it teaches you grit and resilience?
7/1/19, 1:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is one of the things yes. And yes, that is somewhat the question?
7/1/19, 1:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how do you make everything sound so mean.
7/1/19, 1:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean maybe I said it that way
7/1/19, 1:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But when will you realize that there is so much more to life than words
7/1/19, 1:09 PM - Shona 😍: That sounded mean?
7/1/19, 1:09 PM - Shona 😍: I'm sorry
7/1/19, 1:09 PM - Shona 😍: I just tried to be very clear because I wasn't sure I understood
7/1/19, 1:11 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think it's selfish
7/1/19, 1:11 PM - Shona 😍: I just hope it's not the only reason

7/1/19, 4:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a waste of my time
7/1/19, 4:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was a part time work to keep me busy
7/1/19, 5:16 PM - Shona 😍: Did they tell you to stop working on that? Or did you decide by yourself?
7/1/19, 5:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: By myself
7/1/19, 5:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They don't care.
7/1/19, 5:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They seriously and honestly don't

7/1/19, 5:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fingers crossed
7/1/19, 5:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It actually feels like a fucking sauna
7/1/19, 5:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😓
7/1/19, 5:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, Vandana is such a dumbass

7/1/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't
7/1/19, 5:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It just seems so fake
7/1/19, 5:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I so don't like fake people
7/1/19, 5:54 PM - Shona 😍: You don't like the way she's posing.
7/1/19, 5:54 PM - Shona 😍: What was your idea in the beginning?
7/1/19, 5:55 PM - Shona 😍: ?
7/1/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was trying to be non judgemental
7/1/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And give her a second chance
7/1/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But uuuh
7/1/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😠
7/1/19, 5:55 PM - Shona 😍: Why do you feel so strongly about the pose?
7/1/19, 5:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She bought earings for you
7/1/19, 5:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Saying
7/1/19, 5:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That since
7/1/19, 5:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I haven't bought anything for her
7/1/19, 5:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She thought
7/1/19, 5:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will be a good idea
7/1/19, 5:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤬
7/1/19, 5:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then she wants me to lie to you that I bought it
7/1/19, 5:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I can't buy anything for my gal then it's my fucking headache
7/1/19, 5:57 PM - Shona 😍: Okay that I don't like
7/1/19, 5:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know she is being kind
7/1/19, 5:57 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
7/1/19, 5:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But this is actually dumb
7/1/19, 5:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you being 20 years old still don't know your boundaries
7/1/19, 5:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, she is going for a one week vacation on an internship of two months
7/1/19, 5:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And when I asked why
7/1/19, 5:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She said because her family is forcing her
7/1/19, 5:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a family ritual
7/1/19, 6:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That she has to attend
7/1/19, 6:00 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
7/1/19, 6:01 PM - Shona 😍: Family is important. But yeah, so is the internship. And two months is not very long
7/1/19, 6:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Who the hell puts their career on stake because they don't have the balls to open their mouth in front of their family
7/1/19, 6:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is exactly why I was mad at Sukriti the whole time
7/1/19, 6:02 PM - Shona 😍: So she really wouldn't want to go?
7/1/19, 6:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No
7/1/19, 6:04 PM - Shona 😍: Well in that case it's quite a pity
7/1/19, 6:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen to me very carefully
7/1/19, 6:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Open your ear flaps
7/1/19, 6:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd clear your ear canal

7/1/19, 6:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sometimes with no coat
7/1/19, 6:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just to surprise you
7/1/19, 6:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Waiting
7/1/19, 6:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To get a glimpse of you
7/1/19, 6:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just for those 200 ms
7/1/19, 6:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *metres

7/1/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: First she will wear odd stuff and then talk about how people were looking at her or how her mom was objecting about it. Seriously, girl, if that is the case, then why dress up? To eat someone's head?
7/1/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She literally wastes the whole day
7/1/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the job that is given to her is also so shitty
7/1/19, 6:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh god

7/1/19, 6:41 PM - Shona 😍: I'm trying to figure out my priorities with that, if it's good enough
7/1/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: Do you think it's too ambitious to think that I'll walk 3km to the university in the winter?
7/1/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: I can bike in the summer and early autumn and late spring
7/1/19, 6:42 PM - Shona 😍: Also there's public transport
7/1/19, 6:43 PM - Shona 😍: This apartment is in the center of Kuopio, at a harbor
7/1/19, 6:43 PM - Shona 😍: 12m2 in my own room
7/1/19, 6:43 PM - Shona 😍: 36.5m2 the entire place

7/1/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: It's very very affordable

7/1/19, 6:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You kidding me? Snow and 3 KMS?
7/1/19, 6:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 2 is more than enough
7/1/19, 6:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 3 is too much
7/1/19, 6:48 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
7/1/19, 6:48 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe you're right
7/1/19, 6:50 PM - Shona 😍: My mentor told me she biked throughout the winter
7/1/19, 6:50 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe I can too
7/1/19, 6:51 PM - Shona 😍: Or then just take the bus
7/1/19, 6:51 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm

7/1/19, 6:51 PM - Shona 😍: Oh!!!
7/1/19, 6:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I finally was discussing many things with her
7/1/19, 6:51 PM - Shona 😍: How did she like it?
7/1/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. That is still a better option and a more serene one. You will really like biking. It feels like work in the beginning but it gets much easier
7/1/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She found it tough as well
7/1/19, 6:52 PM - Shona 😍: But she made it through!
7/1/19, 6:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I have a faint rememberance that you like biking?
7/1/19, 6:53 PM - Shona 😍: Uh sure
7/1/19, 6:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There are other ways to train that. Or maybe not. But baby. Walking 3 kms in snow is not feasible. Its not
7/1/19, 6:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. I am sure. You do.
7/1/19, 6:54 PM - Shona 😍: 😅
7/1/19, 6:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can tame a horse?
7/1/19, 6:54 PM - Shona 😍: Wat
7/1/19, 6:55 PM - Shona 😍: You think that's easier?
7/1/19, 7:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well if you're to ride me like we have planned for the next month and a half then certainly riding will be easier
7/1/19, 7:06 PM - Shona 😍: Well good thing that I know how to ride then
7/1/19, 7:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does that have any sort of remotest effect on you?
7/1/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: What exactly?
7/1/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: What you just said?
7/1/19, 7:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does that do anything for you
7/1/19, 7:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The riding discussion?
7/1/19, 7:09 PM - Shona 😍: Not yet
7/1/19, 7:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm

7/1/19, 7:12 PM - Shona 😍: I have no idea what's the next thing they'll offer me
7/1/19, 7:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or how do then students manage
7/1/19, 7:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Generally they don't
7/1/19, 7:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So

7/1/19, 7:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A 12m2 is what I had in my campus
7/1/19, 7:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think 12 m2 is enough for a student
7/1/19, 7:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's cozy
7/1/19, 7:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd easy to maintain
7/1/19, 7:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And can very easily be made into one's own
7/1/19, 7:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤨
7/1/19, 7:14 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah...
7/1/19, 7:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Freezer and Oven are a must
7/1/19, 7:15 PM - Shona 😍: :|
7/1/19, 7:15 PM - Shona 😍: Then I would need to get something else
7/1/19, 7:15 PM - Shona 😍: Than a student apartment
7/1/19, 7:15 PM - Shona 😍: They are much more expensive
7/1/19, 7:16 PM - Shona 😍: I think I'd need to take the loan
7/1/19, 7:16 PM - Shona 😍: But maybe that's not the worst option
7/1/19, 7:17 PM - Shona 😍: I'm just wondering how much will I be cooking anyway
7/1/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
7/1/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good point

7/1/19, 7:19 PM - Shona 😍: But that's it
7/1/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok.
7/1/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Respect level plummeted dramatically
7/1/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: From this
7/1/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To this
7/1/19, 7:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://chat.whatsapp.com/CTFwjb8RU6jI4T9DVlGmFj
7/1/19, 7:20 PM - Shona 😍: ?
7/1/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: What's this?
7/1/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: 😄
7/1/19, 7:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is Faizal for you😅
7/1/19, 7:31 PM - Shona 😍: 😄
7/1/19, 7:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't wait for you to meet them
7/1/19, 7:59 PM - Shona 😍: Me neither 😊
7/1/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: Random people or people you know?
7/1/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's better if we talk about it on call
7/1/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or why
7/1/19, 9:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not
7/1/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always thought this question will be our end
7/1/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's good that you asked
7/1/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So the thing is
7/1/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I cant imagine faces.
7/1/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I fantasize people who I have known seen or been with in the past
7/1/19, 9:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I obviously guilt after that
7/1/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that's how it is
7/1/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I try imagining and of the times I do, I really feel good
7/1/19, 9:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then we have had very light memories with each other in terms of the level of intimacy reached and the same required for masturbating so, I can't usually think of stuff
7/1/19, 9:33 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm.
7/1/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: I guess that's the benefit of being only one person. You just can't think about someone else because you don't have anything you could think of. I mean not everyone thinks of that as a benefit. But I think I do. Makes me think about the church I used to be part of and the couples that got married when they were quite young. They hadn't been with anyone else. Somehow I think that's really sweet.
7/1/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: Being with only *
7/1/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah I think that too
7/1/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But .
7/1/19, 9:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can't change my past.
7/1/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would want to erase those particular kinds of thoughts but
7/1/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, porn is another source of
7/1/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Such thoughts
7/1/19, 9:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
7/1/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: I know
7/1/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: It just makes me think about my own choices
7/1/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: About being with only one person?
7/1/19, 10:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or choosing me as your life partner?
7/1/19, 10:14 PM - Shona 😍: Both
7/1/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What about them?
7/1/19, 10:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Rethinking us?
7/1/19, 10:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Obviously you are feeling good about this one
7/1/19, 10:54 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
7/1/19, 10:54 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna go to a church tomorrow, before the doctor's appointment
7/1/19, 10:54 PM - Shona 😍: Glad you reminded me about that earlier

7/2/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona. But paying 100 for two months is non sense
7/2/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They can't just throw a shitty offer that you have to take up
7/2/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, Kela's benefits are limited. The more you withdraw rn the less you get later

7/2/19, 12:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The 140 extra is the problem
7/2/19, 12:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's it
7/2/19, 12:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am going to shush now. 😕
7/2/19, 12:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is about a 30 pricier

7/2/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
7/2/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have changed my mind.
7/2/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am onboard with the decision
7/2/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You should take it
7/2/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When life seems in disarray. Nature is the sole rescuer.
7/2/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yeah if there are not going to be any freezers or oven anywhere then it doesn't matter
7/2/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you said money doesn't matter
7/2/19, 12:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But they will cost you a hell lot
7/2/19, 12:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://verkkokauppa.lumo.fi/vuokra-asunnot/Kuopio
7/2/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So the average price for apartments is not much there.
7/2/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it's not like a crazy good deal
7/2/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is just an ok ok deal
7/2/19, 12:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://verkkokauppa.lumo.fi/vuokra-asunnot/Kuopio/itkonniemenkatu-4-kuopio-1976
7/2/19, 12:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Rent a place and then find a flatmate on Facebook
7/2/19, 12:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is still a better option
7/2/19, 12:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean can't for sure
7/2/19, 12:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it certainly is another viable option
7/2/19, 12:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you take this one then to hedge the costs you will have to take it long term
7/2/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you call them for how likely is there a chance for you to get another Offer?
7/2/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do that
7/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because if you are likely to get another offer
7/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then what's the point
7/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, tell them it's only the extra two months that's keeping you
7/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: From taking the offer
7/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you still need onr
7/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *one
7/2/19, 12:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They will probably escalate your query
7/2/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry I didn't help with the decision making
7/2/19, 12:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I will make a decision tree Tomorrow and send it to you
7/2/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean we have the information yes.
7/2/19, 12:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But no we haven't decided

7/2/19, 12:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow these days I am not able to cheer you up
7/2/19, 12:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something that makes me want to kill myself
7/2/19, 12:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What's the use of a life in which you can't keep your beloved Happy

I know I was busy a lot of time, and I did prioritize the exam and keeping my own head together for that. And with that, with the exam, I was thinking about the future. Not just mine but ours too. I also did many times change my schedule for you. But did I leave you by yourself? Do you feel wronged by my choices back then?
7/2/19, 10:25 AM - Shona 😍: You can reply later

7/2/19, 4:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❣
7/2/19, 4:40 PM - Shona 😍: She held my hand and stroked my arm, made it so much easier and comfortable
7/2/19, 4:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's called the gareway theory of pain
7/2/19, 4:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yes it helps
7/2/19, 4:43 PM - Shona 😍: Also the doctor and the nurse were lovely, both youngish women
7/2/19, 4:44 PM - Shona 😍: Pinching or contracting in the uterus, that's what it feels like :P
7/2/19, 4:46 PM - Shona 😍: It may continue for a couple days
7/2/19, 4:46 PM - Shona 😍: And some bleeding
7/2/19, 4:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Never mind.

7/2/19, 4:49 PM - Shona 😍: Glad that Laura pointed it out
7/2/19, 4:49 PM - Shona 😍: So I'm not taking the apartment
7/2/19, 4:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that makes the choice easier
7/2/19, 4:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
7/2/19, 4:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Glad I didn't make a decision tree
7/2/19, 4:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤣
7/2/19, 4:49 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂
7/2/19, 5:00 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I'm sososooso relieved
7/2/19, 5:00 PM - Shona 😍: I was expecting like hours of torture 😂😂😂😂😂
7/2/19, 5:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are a freak
7/2/19, 5:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know that right?
7/2/19, 5:00 PM - Shona 😍: I mean the paining can come a bit later
7/2/19, 5:01 PM - Shona 😍: Well for Laura it was like that!!
7/2/19, 5:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am off to buy my sister's laptop

7/2/19, 5:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That
7/2/19, 5:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It doesn't matter how much you plan
7/2/19, 5:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somethings will automatically fall in place
7/2/19, 5:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So chillax and let things take their time

7/2/19, 6:25 PM - Shona 😍: What does that mean
7/2/19, 6:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In times like these I start wondering if I forgot something
7/2/19, 6:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🙄
7/2/19, 6:30 PM - Shona 😍: What could you possibly have forgotten? You got the laptop? Did you need something else with it?
7/2/19, 6:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What do I know
7/2/19, 6:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If I forgot
7/2/19, 6:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How can I recall
7/2/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅

7/2/19, 6:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not asking you to
7/2/19, 6:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just sharing a general feeling that I have

7/2/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ONLY
7/2/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't you dare forget that. Na aa.  Dont. Please. It's both a warning and a plea
7/2/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: I think I'll remember
7/2/19, 6:45 PM - Shona 😍: I mean I'm more likely the too careful one, right
7/2/19, 6:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!
7/2/19, 6:45 PM - Shona 😍: I'm starting to get really excited
7/2/19, 6:45 PM - Shona 😍: Also freaking out 😄
7/2/19, 6:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But don't be overcareful. Enjoy yourself as well. I will be there to protect you.
7/2/19, 6:46 PM - Shona 😍: Yeeeeeeees
7/2/19, 6:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. It's too showy. She is hiding her own self. 😕🤨😒

7/2/19, 6:49 PM - Shona 😍: Which one
7/2/19, 6:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not to mention whatever the whole coach is trying to find between her boobs
7/2/19, 6:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The black
7/2/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The lady in the orange is wearing a suit
7/2/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The same thing you wore for Bhangra
7/2/19, 6:51 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm kay
7/2/19, 6:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is very much covered
7/2/19, 6:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The girl in  black was basically wearing the white spaghetti(however you spell it)that you wear while sleeping.
7/2/19, 6:52 PM - Shona 😍: Oh 😅😅😅😅😅
7/2/19, 6:53 PM - Shona 😍: Btw it's spelled exactly like that
7/2/19, 6:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thanks😘
7/2/19, 6:54 PM - Shona 😍: Hihi
7/2/19, 6:54 PM - Shona 😍: I saw an old couple jaywalking today
7/2/19, 6:54 PM - Shona 😍: The lady even had a walker
7/2/19, 6:55 PM - Shona 😍: It was really cute
7/2/19, 6:55 PM - Shona 😍: I usually people even my age don't in such a situation
7/2/19, 6:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry what?
7/2/19, 6:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
7/2/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm ignore the I in the beginning. Mostly people wait for the light to turn green in such a crossing. Even young people, who are imo the most likely to jaywalk.
7/2/19, 7:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
7/2/19, 7:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I finally figured what was wrong with my Excel sheet
7/2/19, 7:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And why it was loading so slow
7/2/19, 7:17 PM - Shona 😍: What was it?
7/2/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I had used some formulas
7/2/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That could have been avoided
7/2/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now I just need peaceful 3-4 hours to finish the job
7/2/19, 7:17 PM - Shona 😍: 🥳🥳
7/2/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or if not that then the whole day for tomorrow
7/2/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the job will be done.
7/2/19, 7:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So.
7/2/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: Awesome!
7/2/19, 7:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All's well that ends well
7/2/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: Hyvä poika
7/2/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: Fiksu poika
7/2/19, 7:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yup
7/2/19, 7:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My god! It has been such a learning curve
7/2/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: Would be fun to see a curve on a tablet like I had 😄
7/2/19, 7:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish!
7/2/19, 7:19 PM - Shona 😍: Those are satisfying to see
7/2/19, 7:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yupp
7/2/19, 7:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wish I could learn Alteryx and PowerBi as much
7/2/19, 7:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will be so so good.
7/2/19, 7:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I seriously know Excel and PowerPoint in and out now
7/2/19, 7:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just need to learn these now
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: That's so nice
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will be a happy man
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok maybe data science too
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: Hehe
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that is a science in itself
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that takes time
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think there's an end to it
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: You can always learn more!
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But these can be learnt quickly
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: These
7/2/19, 7:21 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
7/2/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: Ah
7/2/19, 7:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Come soon I will show you my magic
7/2/19, 7:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But still there is so much more to be learnt in excel

7/2/19, 7:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No

7/2/19, 7:23 PM - Shona 😍: You can be both
7/2/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You hate that word dont you?
7/2/19, 7:23 PM - Shona 😍: I got a little aroused
7/2/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😳😱😨😱😳😨😨😳😱😳😳😨😨😳
7/2/19, 7:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What the fuck!

7/2/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Seriously what?
7/2/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am getting aroused too
7/2/19, 7:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😃
7/2/19, 7:24 PM - Shona 😍: I have no idea 😂
7/2/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm maybe that will suffice
7/2/19, 7:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Use it hard.
7/2/19, 7:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Fuck you!❣
7/2/19, 7:35 PM - Shona 😍: I will.
7/2/19, 7:35 PM - Shona 😍: Fuck you too
7/2/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: Can we talk about rimming
7/2/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: ?
7/2/19, 7:51 PM - Shona 😍: Not necessarily now
7/2/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: But at some point
7/2/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes we can
7/2/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Definitely
7/2/19, 7:52 PM - Shona 😍: I did some research 😬
7/2/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We don't have to delay it
7/2/19, 7:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Enlighten me
7/2/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah wait a sec
7/2/19, 7:54 PM - Shona 😍: I try to make a summary
7/2/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: Can you stay neutral if I talk in medical terms?
7/2/19, 8:01 PM - Shona 😍: I mean only that side
7/2/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: That you don't get agitated
7/2/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
7/2/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not
7/2/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I promise
7/2/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: Good
7/2/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: I've started to like the idea
7/2/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: So
7/2/19, 8:17 PM - Shona 😍: So in most articles I read it's adviced to use something as protection when doing it, like a dental dam or a cut condom. That's to not to get the bacteria/possible parasites/viruces/diseases to the mouth. In our case we don't need to worry about the stds but still the bacteria and other micro-organisms part applies. Also, anything that's been in the asshole shouldn't go in the vagina, it's a risk for several infections like vaginitis and cystitis. And those suck also because then future sex is not so nice/possible in a while. So cleaning stuff when moving from one area to the other is important. But the analingus part. How do you feel about using some protection if we do that, I mean in both cases if I lick you or you lick me?
7/2/19, 8:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Protection how
7/2/19, 8:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I can't imagine what to use and how?
7/2/19, 8:22 PM - Shona 😍: Having the dental dam or a cut condom in the between
7/2/19, 8:23 PM - Shona 😍: Like you would if you want protection when giving oral sex to a woman
7/2/19, 8:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh
7/2/19, 8:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
7/2/19, 8:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Got it
7/2/19, 8:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know if it will be the same
7/2/19, 8:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do I necessarily have to use it when I do something to you?
7/2/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: Well I would like you to... It was really difficult to find actual medical articles about it. I mean I couldn't. So I'd like to ask an actual doctor what's the deal in reality. Like if the risk is even high or not.
7/2/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: Probably not exactly the same
7/2/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: But apparently the dental dam is the best option
7/2/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if it's thinner or what
7/2/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: Or maybe just easier to use
7/2/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: If it is done without the protection I mean
7/2/19, 8:47 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm okay I found one credible health professional site, they suggest it too
7/2/19, 8:48 PM - Shona 😍: Please tell me how you feel about this all.
7/2/19, 8:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If that is  how it is. Then yes, I will use protection
7/2/19, 9:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really respect your priorities
7/2/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I understand that this is an important one.
7/2/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: While I am generally more reckless
7/2/19, 9:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I can restrict such behavior to my own self
7/2/19, 9:05 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm. I don't know if I should be sorry for that now that you're with me, I'm gonna be concerned about your health too. I mean I obviously think it's for your good. But I'm not sure how annoying you find it
7/2/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Its bearable. 😃
7/2/19, 9:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So chillax
7/2/19, 9:05 PM - Shona 😍: I know I like it when you teach me to be a bit more reckless :P
7/2/19, 9:05 PM - Shona 😍: 😅
7/2/19, 9:12 PM - Shona 😍: Btw
7/2/19, 9:12 PM - Shona 😍: I feel great
7/2/19, 9:13 PM - Shona 😍: I mean quite normal
7/2/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: Some faint sensations in the lower stomach
7/2/19, 9:14 PM - Shona 😍: But that's it
7/2/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's good

7/6/19, 12:54 PM - Shona 😍: But I don't think I've actually been pissed about this kind of a thing before
7/6/19, 12:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would still say is better than 40+4 of neutral
7/6/19, 12:54 PM - Shona 😍: I've just felt surprised
7/6/19, 12:55 PM - Shona 😍: What do you mean by those times?
7/6/19, 12:55 PM - Shona 😍: I mean I get the point
7/6/19, 12:55 PM - Shona 😍: But what do they have to do with this situation
7/6/19, 12:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 40 mins of feeling bad that he is late then getting surprised that he came and feeling good. For about a few hours
7/6/19, 12:56 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmmm
7/6/19, 12:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or the same time spent being neutral
7/6/19, 12:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It maybe the same in every situation
7/6/19, 12:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's just that
7/6/19, 12:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I do it because of this logic
7/6/19, 12:56 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm but I'll be happy anyway when you come, not neutral
7/6/19, 12:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If you don't find it ok or if you don't feel the same
7/6/19, 12:57 PM - Shona 😍: But do you think there's additional happiness because of the contrast to the crappy?
7/6/19, 12:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then I can stop
7/6/19, 12:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.

7/9/19, 3:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Listen, I was thinking, that we can't be sure that the FabIndia candle would have been good. Because candles don't always smell the same when hot as compared to what they smell when they are cold.

We have not been texting at all lately. Something that somehow was so vital for our survival feels good for a change to not have that. But that's not what I want to say. What I actually want to say is that I live you. Each day  I wake up and I look at you and I look around and I feel that how can I make you smile and how can I make it better for you. Whenever I look at something new and something good I just feel that this may be something that you may like and then I just want to make that happen for you. I really like it baby when you smile. Your smiles are the most precious thing to me. Sometimes it so happens that we try something new and then you don't like it. And I am doing 🤦🏻‍♂ this, then there are some other times when I see that I wasn't even trying and you do 😃 and then I do 🙇🏻. You are a puzzle, a mystery, something that I really like to solve each day. You are everything to me, I hope these last three days have been good for you. I hope that you liked everything so far. It feels good to do these things with you. It has been a revelation to be with you and discover these things. I hope I am able to make you smile like this, ALWAYS. Happy Monday baby. Good morning. ♥

7/20/19, 2:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So.
7/20/19, 3:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning.
7/20/19, 3:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was not shopping last night. Actually I was but lets keep that discussion for later in the day.
7/20/19, 3:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You deleted this message
7/20/19, 3:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For now. I wanted to say something.
7/20/19, 3:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I was sitting next to you about the whole 4 hours until now, since you slept. Honestly, I didn't even look at you. But occasionally I could hear you breathe. I could sense you move and every now and then I could smell something funny 😌, I am guessing there is some movement afterall 🤭

But whenever all this happened I used to turn, not physically but attentively and everytime I did. I couldn't believe my senses. How could it be! February I was crying for you. Last may I was craving for you. Last September I was cooking for you. But how come at this moment I have you next to me. Like I always wanted. No disturbing, nothing. How come! I seriously, can't believe it Shona. I remember how I used to cry thinking about you and missing you in February. How I used to pull my hair. Bang my chest and throw my arms in disgust. But now I can cook for you again. Bathe you again. Laugh with you again and rejoice with you again. Somehow, until now, since you have come. I didn't get the time to think, how big this is. But God is if unbelievable. To have you and to know you are mine. I love you baby. A very good morning. It is still unbelievable that you are here and you sleep next to me. At an arms length. To put in numbers a distance of 6107 km was reduced to less than a metre. That's a 99.999986% decrease from May and April. I feel the reduction in emotional distance can't be gauged but I am sure it is no less astronomical. You are amazing from distance but mesmerizing when sleeping next to me. Emotionally or physically. The kind of mesmerizing that you had that day in the lake. When you are around everything is ☮️ and serene. I love you baby. If you are reading this and I am still sleeping next to you then please come and kiss me. I would love to fit in your kisses in my dreams. and do whisper something in my ear. I will guess later maybe if I can. Will be fun to see if I can at all. ♥🤭❣
7/20/19, 3:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning and I love you.

7/27/19, 10:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a Hindi word we say for a concrete promise. The whole phrase is Pakka promise. You remember Kaccha houses? House built with sand and mud? Or houses that are not sturdy? Pakka is the antonym of Kaccha. So. Something that is sturdy or concrete. So a concrete promise. So Pakka promise I will try to tell you the next time

7/28/19, 12:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will feel full and sleep better
7/28/19, 12:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe Iranians make fun of other accents because accents are a big part of their culture. Maybe children are specifically trained for their accents and how they speak
7/28/19, 12:46 PM - Shona 😍: Okkapokka
7/28/19, 12:46 PM - Shona 😍: Maybeeee

7/28/19, 5:52 PM - Shona 😍: I don't remember packing it either

7/28/19, 9:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 10 mins at max
7/28/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a question
7/28/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: Tell me
7/28/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't like gold. Probably those earings had nickel and you won't be able to wear them. Why did you say to Vandana you like them?
7/28/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, you are hurt because I made you feel inadequate? Or because I was rude to you? Or Because I asked you to speak up forcefully against your will?
7/28/19, 11:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And if none of those apply then please think and  let me know what you think is the reason. Because I am finding it hard to figure it out myself
7/29/19, 12:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I guess you have slept. Good night baby.
7/29/19, 3:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mostly like chirping but yeah quiet is enjoyable too. I used to love our times in Espoo. They were pleasant for me. But i can't enjoy being quiet when there are fundamental questions looming around in my head. And that was the case today or has been the case in this trip by far.
7/29/19, 8:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
7/29/19, 9:17 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
7/29/19, 10:03 AM - Shona 😍: It's not that I don't like gold. I only think that silver complements my skin tone better. And those earrings were truly beautiful in themselves. Yeah I can't wear them for long periods of time because of the nickel. It was really sweet of Vandana to get those for me, and on some occasions I can wear them. Or Laura can, or someone else. They were a gift from Vandu and I cherish that.
7/29/19, 11:01 AM - Shona 😍: I still didn't understand what did you want from me, when you asked how long do I want you to wait. Wait for what? Wait for me to be able to make a given decision in a given time period? Who decides that time period? Me? You? Who are you to decide those time periods for me? I can use your suggestions as guidelines, but if you're telling me some limits it feels like you're my coach or something, and that I don't want from my partner. If I want to change myself in some ways what is helpful is that I get your support in that. 
Other than the decision making, it was about me speaking up, right? The more you push for that, the less I want to say. Yesterday on the train, or in the evening when I was patting your back I didn't feel any pressure. I really felt like talking. And when I feel at peace with myself, then I feel like talking.  Yeah I need to learn to speak up when I'm anxious too. I have learnt it a lot already, compared to before. For example I woke you up in the middle of the night because I couldn't sleep. I didn't do that a year ago. 
Yeah I could speak up more, and I want to. The change has been happening really slowly so far, because I've mostly been doing it on my own. Why I thought therapy would be a good option is because it would make the change faster. I would have help and also accountability for that. I don't want you to be my accountability partner for that because it feels like you don't accept me before I reach some level that you approve of. And that level seems to change and is dependent on your mood too. A year ago you even told me not to change myself, that being quiet is totally fine, that changing that is more wrong. I didn't agree with that back then though.
You're allowed to change your mind, everyone is.
And I am serious about the decision making. The elephant tattoo is about that for me. I never thought I would have the guts to get a tattoo, and it seemed like it will just be something I occasionally think about and then forget. What you said about committing to the decisions really resonated with me. And now I have a reminder of that in the form of an animal that I love, tattooed on my very own skin. And the fact that I will get something imprinted on my body is huge for me. I can easily go to medical procedures even if I'm scared of a needle and some pain  and calm myself down by telling myself that it's for my own good. I can trust the medical professionals and they do it to improve my health or to get information about it. And that works because I value physical health a lot. But I've finally started to realize that physical health is not all that matters. When Nimz was doing the tattoo on me, I didn't quite have the answer, why am I doing this to my body, why am I taking this pain and actually putting my health at some level of risk, no matter how small, it's extra risk anyway, just to have a drawing on my skin. I compared it in my mind to the medical procedures and I couldn't calm myself in the same way. But then I realized, and remember now, that it's to remind me about the decisions. Even if the worst happens and I end up losing my leg or something due to infection, it is still gonna be a decision that i made and commit to, no matter how bad or good it is. And in addition to that it reminds me that physical health is not all that matters. So please understand that it was an enormous step for me, even if it wasn't like that for you. It was a big step in changing something in my core and my values, a concrete and lasting mark of that.
Maybe you can understand that when you on the very next day of me getting that tattoo ask that how long do you need to wait for me to change these things, I feel like nothing will be enough for you to tell that I am serious with this. That is not to say that I got the tattoo for you. It was for myself, but you encouraged me to be bold and get it done because I wanted it. And that is something I cherish. But what hurts is that you didn't even seem to notice or care about the changes that I have already made.
7/29/19, 11:33 AM - Shona 😍: However, maybe my pace is too slow for you. These arguments and the tough times, new challenges push me forward, and that is good. Otherwise the pace would be too slow for anyone. But you really need to think if it's too slow for you and then let me know, and we can go our ways.

I really like having sex with you and I wouldn't mind having more of it in general. Today was an exception... And we've had many other things we've been doing that are also important, during our time together.

8/3/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let it not be my testament
8/3/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of how much I miss you

8/3/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you at lot
8/3/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What are you upto?
8/3/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: I miss you babu. Mum just replied to my voice mail and she told that it's 17°C in Finland, saying, it's the typical Finnish summer... And that's so true. And it got me thinking how much I love this heat here, and all the other things I love about this place. Of course I gotta mention food, I can't shut up about it... I had dinner in the mess and as again, I wasn't disappointed :) It was quite basic food again, dahl, rice, roti and some vegetable stuff. I had green chili with it and I enjoyed how it gently burned in my mouth. I had nuts for dessert (5 + 5 hehe) and then went for a walk. The air was still humid from the rain but it wasn't actually raining anymore. I admired the deep green leaves of the different trees, and how the light of the street lamps shone through them. It was also dark enough so that people didn't stare at me, which was delightful. Not that I mind the staring that much anymore, I'm pretty much used to it by now. In my hostel when people pass me they usually look but then I just smile and they smile back and that's nice. In Finland people don't usually even maintain eye contact for that long.
Oh and another thing that I noticed in the mess was that people who were eating alone were not on their phones, but they were focusing on the food and enjoying it. I did the same. I usually do, even in Finland. But I'm more used to seeing everyone else using their phones when eating at the uni's cafeteria for example.
As I said, I really am enjoying the warmth. Of course it's easy for me to say with the ac in my room... But I also love going outside and not feeling cold or chilly! I can't even tell you how much I like that. I easily feel cold in Finland, all around the year. Hmm maybe I just need to learn to dress more appropriately for the weather... I'm gonna be using the vests you left for me last year, I think that'll help.
Another thing I really like here is all the different smells. The smell of the flowers yesterday was incredible. Also when I walk in the hostel, I can occasionally smell some really nice incence that someone's burning. There are also more unpleasant smells, like from the sewers, or when we were driving through Kanpur. But somehow even that's refreshing, to smell all those different things instead of just all being clean and sterile and not smelling much of anything. 
The doggos are also insanely cute and when I see them sleeping in different places in the hostel or in the yard my heart melts. I would really love to pat them but I'm still unsure of how they behave and if they're actually that clean...
I hope we can go to Kanpur some day so that I get to know it a bit better. Just driving through it once didn't tell that much.
Shona I hope some day I can call this country my other home. It's so little that I have seen of it, and I don't know what all is there more to explore. I have no idea. But I just want to say that I've loved my stay here. With you I've felt safe everywhere that I've gone to, and I've loved to hear all the things that you've told me about your country. I feel so much closer to you now that I've seen and experienced all these things myself. I said that I hope that some day I can call this country my other home. There are many things that also terrify me about it. And meeting, spending time and possibly living some time with your mother and sister is among those things. But I'm getting ahead of myself. For now I want to focus on what we have.  I don't want to worry about what is to come, we will manage it when the time comes. The future will be what we make it to be. I love you.

8/4/19, 10:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ❣
8/4/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't do a single bit of coding since yesterday

8/4/19, 11:04 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
8/4/19, 11:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought I will not say
8/4/19, 11:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But we both know how that ends
8/4/19, 11:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I thought I will say

8/4/19, 11:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both Maa and me are used to it
8/4/19, 11:06 AM - Shona 😍: Or is it just you thinking she's acting weird because she knows
8/4/19, 11:07 AM - Shona 😍: Mmh
8/4/19, 11:07 AM - Shona 😍: Well is it her normal then? And not especially weird
8/4/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
8/4/19, 11:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is very normal with her
8/4/19, 11:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And lets say even if it is about my relationship
8/4/19, 11:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If my Maa can give me space in Jan
8/4/19, 11:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then so should she
8/4/19, 11:09 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah
8/4/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But expecting that I will compromise
8/4/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I think is too much
8/4/19, 11:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you have Jalebi Poha for brekafast?

8/4/19, 11:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A goto system in case of emoional emergency
8/4/19, 11:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: in this case
8/4/19, 11:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: the career focussed planning that we have done
8/4/19, 11:14 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm I see
8/4/19, 11:14 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah, it's good to have that
8/4/19, 11:14 AM - Shona 😍: As something you can focus on
8/4/19, 11:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But dont feel negrlected
8/4/19, 11:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: or like I am casting you aside
8/4/19, 11:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Unlike you in the past with your plans

8/4/19, 11:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just promise me
8/4/19, 11:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: that you will let me know if you need me
8/4/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: Earlier in the morning I was missing you, and I thought of the time when I'm gonna leave, and the days that will follow when I can't be with you, and my heart sunk.
8/4/19, 11:22 AM - Shona 😍: But somehow time spent apart seems to do good, in other ways
8/4/19, 11:23 AM - Shona 😍: I can appreciate it better when I'm with you
8/4/19, 11:24 AM - Shona 😍: Or maybe I'm just making shit up trying to make sense of it
8/4/19, 11:24 AM - Shona 😍: Anyhow
8/4/19, 11:24 AM - Shona 😍: Go code your ass off

8/4/19, 11:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yeah I feel it too
8/4/19, 11:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Time apart is very nice. And I beleive this time, these four months will matter a lot
8/4/19, 11:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They will give us  a lot of time to think about the future
8/4/19, 11:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because now we are sure of what we will have
8/4/19, 11:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I love it
8/4/19, 11:26 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah
8/4/19, 11:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the practicalities of it present themselves over a  more elongated period of time
8/4/19, 11:27 AM - Shona 😍: My life will change in almost every possible way though
8/4/19, 11:27 AM - Shona 😍: Me too
8/4/19, 11:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: and it is quite lovely to see that our gambles have played in our favor so far

8/4/19, 11:28 AM - Shona 😍: Yes

8/4/19, 11:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ANd as I have always said
8/4/19, 11:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is the little things that matter

8/4/19, 11:31 AM - Shona 😍: Well you're wrong
8/4/19, 11:31 AM - Shona 😍: How could it be decreasing?
8/4/19, 11:32 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because in this while I relaized I dont think I know you as much as I think I do

8/4/19, 11:33 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe

8/4/19, 11:42 AM - Shona 😍: 🧡
8/4/19, 11:43 AM - Shona 😍: I'm so glad
8/4/19, 1:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
8/4/19, 1:55 PM - Shona 😍: This sounds reasonable, the 4 sets and 4 hours
8/4/19, 1:55 PM - Shona 😍: If you really focus
8/4/19, 1:55 PM - Shona 😍: And that leaves some time for other things too
8/4/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: The normal stuff
8/4/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: But no more than that, I would say
8/4/19, 1:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes!

8/4/19, 5:31 PM - Shona 😍: I can wait...
8/4/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: Someone from my hostel just stopped me and complimented me on how traditional and sweet I look in the kurti 😄 I'm wearing the one with the leaves and the palazzos
8/4/19, 6:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi

8/4/19, 7:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: about how my sister should work on building her resume
8/4/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: How did that go?
8/4/19, 7:34 PM - Shona 😍: The conversation
8/4/19, 7:35 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah, I think it's best to make the goals attainable
8/4/19, 7:35 PM - Shona 😍: Or very close to that
8/4/19, 7:35 PM - Shona 😍: It feels good to reach them then

8/6/19, 10:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand
8/6/19, 10:26 AM - Shona 😍: Should we skip Agra?
8/6/19, 10:27 AM - Shona 😍: Then we could spend more elsewhere
8/6/19, 10:30 AM - Shona 😍: Earlier I didn't account for the books I need to buy

8/6/19, 10:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Lucknow can be done in 1500
8/6/19, 10:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is what I thought, but the thing is that you made a very right point that 70 euros is peanuts as opposed to what you would have spent in Finland.
8/6/19, 10:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or we can skip Lucknow and go to Agra.
8/6/19, 10:39 AM - Shona 😍: Nah, 1500 is nothing
8/6/19, 10:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If we go via scooty
8/6/19, 10:39 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Which I am thinking will be a good road trip, keeping in mind yesterday

8/6/19, 10:41 AM - Shona 😍: Can we manage the rest of the time with 350e?

8/6/19, 10:42 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Past Kunj: yeah yeah totally don't even think about. No sweat.

8/6/19, 10:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That in the event of giving me space. I think we are over adjusting and now  I am not helping you with these things.
8/6/19, 10:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should we divide and conquer?
8/6/19, 10:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like I divided my worries with you and got rid of em
8/6/19, 10:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So could you please let me in on some of yours?

8/6/19, 3:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then why pay the fine
8/6/19, 3:18 PM - Shona 😍: Paypal will also cost
8/6/19, 3:18 PM - Shona 😍: And I can't seem to figure out the whole budget now
8/6/19, 3:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona
8/6/19, 3:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can you please wait for 2 more hours?
8/6/19, 3:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Can we discuss this before acting?
8/6/19, 3:20 PM - Shona 😍: Ok accha
8/6/19, 3:20 PM - Shona 😍: 👍🏼
8/6/19, 9:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Reached
8/6/19, 9:43 PM - Shona 😍: Me too
8/6/19, 10:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
8/6/19, 10:15 PM - Shona 😍: Tell me
8/6/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
8/6/19, 11:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you
8/6/19, 11:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Whenever I am without you, I miss you. I don't know what today was. But it felt serene to be with you. I will be very honest, when I came to you in the afternoon and when I was sleeping hugging your feet. That was the best part of my day. They are so soft and I love kissing them. Somehow makes me feel closer and special both. Because of all the feet we touch in India and all. but that's not the point. What I want to tell you is that generally when I wake up from these afternoon naps, I suffer from anxiety and I get scared, for no reason at all. Maybe it's because of the sudden shock caused by waking up, abruptly from sleep. But what I loved about today was that you were there to calm me and I didn't even notice it after a while. But similarly this emotion was there for the whole day in other things as well. For eg, the evening felt strange but having each other by each other's side made it bearable somehow. Your presence was like a balm. I really love you Shona. Good night. I miss you.
8/7/19, 12:03 AM - Shona 😍: Babu. I felt like I was behaving like a spoiled brat earlier in the day. Maybe it was PMSing combined to the worries about money, loan and the apartment. I felt quite shitty. I can also get very hung up on minor things about my looks when I'm not in a good place otherwise. Like the hair color today. Maybe because that is something I can easily control, unlike the bigger things.
 In any case, I loved being with you and that you beared with me and my crappy mood. I loved kissing you after your nap. I wish I could do that every time you wake up. It was a bit strange to me that you hugged my feet that way when napping. I was just thinking that they must be quite dirty from all the dust around here, why would you want to do that. But you didn't seem to mind so I let it be. Somehow it was very sweet too. But I did wonder that why didn't you turn around head towards the wall and hug my arm or thigh for example. But as I said I let it be because you seemed to like it that way.
8/7/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: The movie was quite bad and trouble with getting the cash wasn't nice either. But being with you was the most important part so it was alright. Actually not just alright but good. I enjoyed my time. And I absolutely love driving on the scooty with you. I love it when you go fast and find your way through the other vehicles when it gets crowded. My eyes and throat are burning from the dust and dirt but it's worth it.
8/7/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: I love you kulta.
8/7/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
8/7/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: And good morning
8/7/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: Puccha x 1000

8/7/19, 8:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't know what to say
8/7/19, 8:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Warms my heart
8/7/19, 8:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really like driving with you as well.
8/7/19, 8:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe we could be that bad ass couple that drives around the city on a superbike in black latex and you lean on me while I make way through the traffic in the streets of Helsinki
8/7/19, 8:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. We will look hot.
8/7/19, 10:15 AM - Shona 😍: Hihi but if you were to drive like you do here, we wouldn't get far 😄 police will stop us
8/7/19, 10:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And will that not be cool. Getting jailed once
8/7/19, 10:18 AM - Shona 😍: 😂
8/7/19, 10:19 AM - Shona 😍: You're hopeless
8/7/19, 10:19 AM - Shona 😍: Also
8/7/19, 10:19 AM - Shona 😍: Turns out I can't send you money via PayPal
8/7/19, 10:20 AM - Shona 😍: Personal transactions are not allowed to/from India or Brazil 😅
8/7/19, 10:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😛😛😛
8/7/19, 10:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well then
8/7/19, 10:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That sums it up
8/7/19, 10:20 AM - Shona 😍: So what we're left with
8/7/19, 10:21 AM - Shona 😍: Is that I use the atm with my card 😬

8/7/19, 12:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ignore
8/8/19, 12:12 AM - Shona 😍: Good night Shona. Maybe you are not the most careful person when it comes to practical things (though you could be much more careless, it's really not that bad) you are the most careful and thoughtful when it comes to emotions and interactions with people. And much fewer people have that, and that is one of the things I value in you the most. I admire it and I adore it.
8/8/19, 1:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night baby. You sitting next to me was the most supportive moments. In the past I have not understood what it means to have someone like that. But it felt totally normal and I think I finally understood what it meant.
8/8/19, 8:46 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
8/8/19, 9:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: good morning babu
8/8/19, 11:13 AM - Shona 😍: I'm glad I was able to be there for you, just sit there with you and be present. Those moments have been rare and so many times it hasn't been possible because of the physical distance. I was also sad to see you go through that and I wish I had had some golden advice to give for that situation. But you found a good solution yourself, I hope it works and that it isn't too hard on you.
8/8/19, 1:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not be coming for lunch
8/8/19, 1:19 PM - Shona 😍: Are you at home?
8/8/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: I'm at the mess
8/8/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: Just came here
8/8/19, 3:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to go flying today?
8/8/19, 3:38 PM - Shona 😍: Totally!
8/8/19, 3:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. Maybe not today. My basketball captain wants to drink 🙄
8/8/19, 3:53 PM - Shona 😍: ?
8/8/19, 3:53 PM - Shona 😍: You want to drink with him?
8/8/19, 3:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah
8/8/19, 3:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I had to agree
8/8/19, 3:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He was very persistent
8/8/19, 3:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want to. But I will have to
8/8/19, 4:33 PM - Shona 😍: In Kanpur?
8/8/19, 8:32 PM - Shona 😍: Baby how is it going there?
8/8/19, 9:34 PM - Shona 😍: Baby?

8/8/19, 10:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Had a three hour long chat about everything
8/8/19, 10:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Told her how her ways of pointing out are negative
8/8/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how she and I need to work as a team
8/8/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And we have our differences in thinking
8/8/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how everything is different as opposed to what it used to be
8/8/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We have both given each other time to think
8/8/19, 10:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I told her that I am still dating you
8/8/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that you came to Delhi
8/8/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To meet me.
8/8/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you went back.
8/8/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that I am serious about you
8/8/19, 10:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that this is not casual what we have
8/8/19, 10:30 PM - Shona 😍: Omfg
8/8/19, 10:30 PM - Shona 😍: I've been nearly shitting my pants here
8/8/19, 10:30 PM - Shona 😍: Being scared of what's going on there
8/8/19, 10:30 PM - Shona 😍: Okay
8/8/19, 10:30 PM - Shona 😍: I'm glad the conversation was fruitful
8/8/19, 10:31 PM - Shona 😍: How did she take all that?
8/8/19, 10:31 PM - Shona 😍: That we're still together and that I came to India
8/8/19, 10:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Pretty boldly
8/8/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She said that it's my decision
8/8/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And she respects it
8/8/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But she thinks that it is wrong
8/8/19, 10:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because you guys have a culture of divorces
8/8/19, 10:32 PM - Shona 😍: That's it?
8/8/19, 10:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that you don't want to live with her.
8/8/19, 10:36 PM - Shona 😍: Well did you tell her that my parents have soon been married for 30 years?
8/8/19, 10:37 PM - Shona 😍: And my grandparents at least 60 years
8/8/19, 10:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes

8/8/19, 10:59 PM - Shona 😍: Was di there also?
8/8/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not yet
8/8/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will have to handle her seperately
8/8/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I studied for an hour for the quiz
8/8/19, 11:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am almost half done
8/8/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will do the rest in the morning
8/8/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: That's great Shona
8/8/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will do great
8/8/19, 11:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't worry
8/8/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: Yes

8/8/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You know better what you see in this relationship
8/8/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I started thinking
8/8/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And this is what I realized
8/8/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is what we have
8/8/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Unstoppable support for each other
8/8/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Even when we can't do anything about it
8/8/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just being there is enough
8/8/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: Yes.
8/8/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: And as hard as it was to see you go again, knowing that we only have two weeks left. You needed to go home to solve this.
8/8/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I felt a tsunami rising within mr

8/16/19, 1:33 AM - Shona 😍: https://www.titan.co.in/shop/watches/brand=titan&gender=men?sort=10&page=3
8/16/19, 1:33 AM - Shona 😍: Which one do you think is better?
8/16/19, 1:33 AM - Shona 😍: Somehow the white dial looks better or prettier
8/16/19, 1:34 AM - Shona 😍: But the black one seems more practical, the contrast is much bigger with the numbers so it's easier to actually tell the time
8/16/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: Otherwise it's the same watch
8/16/19, 1:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. Black offers great contrast

8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It had everything
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Anger
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sandness
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Making up
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Making out
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Love
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sex
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Shona 😍: It was a wonderful day yes
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Drama
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Shona 😍: I feel almost overwhelmed
8/17/19, 12:40 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In what way?
8/17/19, 12:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Overwhelmed as in?
8/17/19, 12:41 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know exactly
8/17/19, 12:42 AM - Shona 😍: But this is the only thing today lacked
8/17/19, 12:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm. 🙄
8/17/19, 12:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good or bad?
8/17/19, 12:55 AM - Shona 😍: I feel restless
8/17/19, 12:55 AM - Shona 😍: The day was good
8/17/19, 12:55 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe it's because you left
8/17/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: I really don't know
8/17/19, 12:58 AM - Shona 😍: Somehow it feels like I had locked myself in this cage
8/17/19, 12:58 AM - Shona 😍: And in the past few days, with our conversations, I've understood that
8/17/19, 12:58 AM - Shona 😍: With all my rules
8/17/19, 12:59 AM - Shona 😍: And like I've been functioning on fear
8/17/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: But now I'm somehow afraid of leaving
8/17/19, 1:02 AM - Shona 😍: Because of how much it will hurt
8/17/19, 1:03 AM - Shona 😍: This was fear of failure
8/17/19, 1:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can understand
8/17/19, 1:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Rules can shelter you from those
8/17/19, 1:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But take my hand shona
8/17/19, 1:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can let go of those now
8/17/19, 1:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am there for you and everything will be fine.
8/17/19, 1:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can function on ambiguity now. At least that arising from the lack of rules.
8/17/19, 1:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It can be tougher for the person who is a foreigner
8/17/19, 1:17 AM - Shona 😍: But by that I meant many other, if not all, things in my life
8/17/19, 1:18 AM - Shona 😍: My thinking
8/17/19, 1:19 AM - Shona 😍: The basis for my decisions
8/17/19, 1:21 AM - Shona 😍: Also fear of... My parents
8/17/19, 1:21 AM - Shona 😍: Wanting to keep them happy
8/17/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: Or not to upset them
8/17/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: Also relating God to that
8/17/19, 1:22 AM - Shona 😍: Thinking that the way I'm doing things is somehow right
8/17/19, 1:23 AM - Shona 😍: Because that's what I was told
8/17/19, 1:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feared that. I kind of could guess. But then your and my situation is not too different. We both are desperately trying to please our parents when they clearly are deciding for us
8/17/19, 1:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's upbringing for you
8/17/19, 1:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Don't worry it's perfect for none.
8/17/19, 1:26 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
8/17/19, 1:45 AM - Shona 😍: Another thing that I fear now is that you will shut me out again when I go
8/17/19, 1:45 AM - Shona 😍: Like you did in June
8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona
8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I promise
8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not
8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will not at all do that
8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I promise
8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will let you know everything
8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Believe

8/17/19, 1:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then you can point out
8/17/19, 1:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I will try and introspect
8/17/19, 1:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How does that sound?
8/17/19, 1:49 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
8/17/19, 1:49 AM - Shona 😍: That should work

8/17/19, 1:52 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah we can plan your schedule together
8/17/19, 1:52 AM - Shona 😍: Sleep kulta
8/17/19, 1:54 AM - Shona 😍: I can take it for a little while if you get... lost. But in the longer run I can't
8/17/19, 1:54 AM - Shona 😍: Meaning that yes I will point it out
8/17/19, 1:55 AM - Shona 😍: And bear with it then
8/17/19, 1:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just point it out

8/22/19, 7:22 PM - Shona 😍: Good night
8/23/19, 12:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey baby. I am glad that you are finally getting some sleep and that you get in the bed familiar to you. I hope you will be able to decide what you like better, hard or soft beds. But not what I wanted to say. What I actually just wanted to say was how happy I was in the evening when I was thinking about you. I was able to be happy about it after I talked to my sister. Almost for an hour. She told me many good things about life. It was I am thinking the first big sister talks she has ever given me. Somehow I am really amazed. Perhaps a validation of how big a role confidence plays in life. Anyways, I guess you will only wake up in the morning. And I somehow am very happy for you. The times ahead are tough but they are not impossible. I was able to appreciate all the good things from our trip with Abhishek  today while I was studying with him. About the decision making, our times together, the rule ideology, the being caught while checking someone out. It just is amazing, seriously. Couldn't stop admiring what we have built. My sister said that I shouldn't get bogged down by you going. She said that I should realize that being depressed is very common for me because whenever I feel distanced emotionally, physically or otherwise from my partner, I feel depressed. Or when things don't go according to my plan. Those were very obvious observations but very interesting that my sister was able to note them. Didn't see that coming. She also told me that a routine will help and gave me the mantra for a good routine. She said that for a good routine to happen, the time, the place should be the same and the milestone setting should be improved. Again, this  is a very generic advice but I didn't realize that I was failing in fixing a time and place. Anyways, I miss you but not in a bad way. I miss you, in any form, digital or physical, we will be able to figure out something with the talking bit and it will be for good. I hope you feel the same. Good night, I love you baby

8/23/19, 1:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then give it up for 70
8/23/19, 1:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Make the other person feel that it's a special accommodation that you are making otherwise you wouldn't have given it up for anything less than 75

8/23/19, 2:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 4
8/23/19, 2:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The sockets were not working
8/23/19, 2:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I think we should write a 5
8/23/19, 2:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And give the guy a genuine feedback

8/23/19, 2:49 PM - Shona 😍: But the rating
8/23/19, 2:50 PM - Shona 😍: 5 doesn't seem too much
8/23/19, 2:50 PM - Shona 😍: With the food

8/23/19, 3:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
8/23/19, 3:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But it is equally placed between airport yellow line and airport line which takes you to the railway station very quickly
8/23/19, 3:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The society is very quiet
8/23/19, 3:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And nice.
8/23/19, 3:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But the plane noises.

8/23/19, 9:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't

8/23/19, 9:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *?
8/23/19, 9:30 PM - Shona 😍: One part that I didn't understand is that how do you DECIDE not to fall in love with someone else. If you're basically doing everything with them. Like how can you decide that, doesn't it just happen
8/23/19, 9:30 PM - Shona 😍: Oooooooooooh my god oh ohoh
8/23/19, 9:31 PM - Shona 😍: I so want to have that
8/23/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exactly. Very hard
8/23/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But not impossible
8/23/19, 9:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Both of the parties have to be very mean and selfish
8/23/19, 9:32 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 9:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Done?

8/23/19, 9:48 PM - Shona 😍: Well that doesn't sound nice
8/23/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah. The orgasms and the heaving bodies are nice.
8/23/19, 9:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The variety of experiences is
8/23/19, 9:50 PM - Shona 😍: I can imagine
8/23/19, 9:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: I have thought about it
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Shona 😍: Not that I want to do it either
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The uncleanliness in some is not
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Some people can be very unhygienic
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is just simply
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yuack
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. Yeah
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But are we being silly about the watchM
8/23/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ?
8/23/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should we sell it?
8/23/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can get 30 for it
8/23/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: But thinking about what it might be like and not completely rejecting the idea, and that is new
8/23/19, 9:52 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
8/23/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is indeed commendable
8/23/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I really like the other one.
8/23/19, 9:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I would rather want you to wear the new one.
8/23/19, 9:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is much prettier
8/23/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: It is awesome
8/23/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: But

8/23/19, 9:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will be glad if you do
8/23/19, 9:55 PM - Shona 😍: Hey I'm already thinking I can give it to our kid or something 😂😂😂 because that would be such a nice story
8/23/19, 9:55 PM - Shona 😍: That it's the first Valentine's gift
8/23/19, 9:55 PM - Shona 😍: But then it would just sit in the closet for... Uh very long
8/23/19, 10:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. I know.
8/23/19, 10:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know. Is it really that close to you?
8/23/19, 10:02 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow it's very dear to me
8/23/19, 10:04 PM - Shona 😍: But maybe you're right
8/23/19, 10:04 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe there's no point in getting attached to such things
8/23/19, 10:14 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>

8/25/19, 1:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
8/25/19, 1:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know what to do
8/25/19, 1:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shopping seems important
8/25/19, 1:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean yeah there are some bad buys.

8/25/19, 1:56 AM - Shona 😍: We didn't plan your weekend
8/25/19, 1:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But she didn't finish her work
8/25/19, 1:56 AM - Shona 😍: Baby you need to focus on your own work
8/25/19, 1:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd that seriously irritates me
8/25/19, 1:56 AM - Shona 😍: You can't take all responsibility for hers
8/25/19, 1:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's her fucking work
8/25/19, 1:57 AM - Shona 😍: Precisely
8/25/19, 1:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Her jneffeciencies are causing me time and mental space
8/25/19, 1:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Unnecessarily doing everything twice.
8/25/19, 1:57 AM - Shona 😍: Why do you do that?
8/25/19, 1:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because I care and I know that no one else would
8/25/19, 1:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *costing
8/25/19, 1:58 AM - Shona 😍: But why isn't she doing it herself?
8/25/19, 1:58 AM - Shona 😍: You can help
8/25/19, 1:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She says she doesn't have the time and she doesn't understand
8/25/19, 1:58 AM - Shona 😍: But you can't let it  fuck up all your own work because of that
8/25/19, 1:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like I was served all that on a plate 😕
8/25/19, 1:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have to learn and be ready to fail
8/25/19, 1:58 AM - Shona 😍: So basically you're just doing it all for her?
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Be criticized
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Shona 😍: How is she so busy anyway?
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hand holding
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A lot of hand holding
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Office and silly formalities
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She had to fill a form today
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like the one I filled for Bain
8/25/19, 1:59 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
8/25/19, 2:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She filled the form for two hours in the morning
8/25/19, 2:00 AM - Shona 😍: And?
8/25/19, 2:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then she printed it
8/25/19, 2:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sent it to three people
8/25/19, 2:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For unnecessary reviews while she was in the office
8/25/19, 2:00 AM - Shona 😍: Unnecessary because?
8/25/19, 2:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then she didn't write the points for her resume which I asked her to
8/25/19, 2:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because it's a fucking form and those people are nobodies
8/25/19, 2:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Except for futile and redundant reviews there is no knowledge there
8/25/19, 2:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They will give a judgement call based on their expectations and experience
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing related to what the form is about
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Shona 😍: 🙄🙄
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you have to be risky with these things
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So what you make a mistake
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Suck it up
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Move on
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can't fucking validate everything
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Shona 😍: Maybe not everything
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Life is not ticks and checks
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Shona 😍: But perhaps some validation is good?
8/25/19, 2:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's risks and failurrs
8/25/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *failures
8/25/19, 2:03 AM - Shona 😍: Not only that
8/25/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah
8/25/19, 2:03 AM - Shona 😍: Some of this as well
8/25/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: True
8/25/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am so sick of her ways of working
8/25/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's so limited and afraid
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What are you afraid of
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ☹😓
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: Does she listen to you
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: When you give advice
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She thinks she knows better
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And she wants to play it safe all the time
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: Well maybe some things she does know better
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: But you have good points too
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: From what I know
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah somethings she does listen for
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: I see
8/25/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: That's good
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But after a lot of debate
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it honestly drains me
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Completely
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Shona 😍: I can understand
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Shona 😍: But good if you make some progress then
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean with you it's a discussion
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Shona 😍: With the debate
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With her it's  drama
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's theatrics
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Shona 😍: So it's not futile
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously
8/25/19, 2:05 AM - Shona 😍: Hmmm
8/25/19, 2:06 AM - Shona 😍: Well that's not nice
8/25/19, 2:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But at what cost. Mental piece?
8/25/19, 2:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *peace
8/25/19, 2:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, change the topic

8/25/19, 2:07 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah! Why didn't you 🤔
8/25/19, 2:07 AM - Shona 😍: Well at the hostel you can't make it

8/25/19, 8:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just realized this. And may be you will realize it too. Go back and look at all your messages today. Your day was just made of superlatives. Just superlatives and I don't think  that it is you using hyperboles. It was that good a day. A whole day given to your family. You take one step forward and they will always give you warmth. You think about them and they will give you the company. It is just amazing isn't it? Glad you had such a day of superlatives. I love you!
8/25/19, 8:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Jealous 🙄

8/26/19, 3:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is a torrent client
8/26/19, 3:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is a torrent link
8/26/19, 3:18 AM - Shona 😍: What does that mean
8/26/19, 3:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That is how you find stuff on the internet
8/26/19, 3:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Torrent is a way of sharing files and it has everything

8/26/19, 3:19 AM - Shona 😍: Wtf
8/26/19, 3:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: After you are done
8/26/19, 3:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will automatically go into the seeding mode
8/26/19, 3:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And support the download of others
8/26/19, 3:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can also set seeding (upload) and leeching (download) speeds
8/26/19, 3:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a way of decentralization
8/26/19, 3:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that no one server/person/company has to have everything
8/26/19, 3:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And a community can fulfill each other's needs
8/26/19, 3:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Movies

8/26/19, 1:30 PM - Shona 😍: Apparently it doesn't make that much difference

8/26/19, 1:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
8/26/19, 1:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. Interest rates are generally nationally decided keeping in mind the economy

8/26/19, 1:32 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
8/26/19, 1:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: and yes, it is convenient to go with your current bank

8/26/19, 1:36 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmm

8/27/19, 3:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now don't be a bitch and become egoistic that it's all because of me. Please love me too. 😛😛😛 But, yes, don't forget your own contribution
8/27/19, 3:36 PM - Shona 😍: Ahahahh
8/27/19, 3:36 PM - Shona 😍: No I won't
8/27/19, 3:36 PM - Shona 😍: You seriously taught me that with your own example
8/27/19, 3:36 PM - Shona 😍: You did it for me first
8/27/19, 4:09 PM - Shona 😍: I got the loan
8/27/19, 4:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On what terms
8/27/19, 4:30 PM - Shona 😍: What all do you want to know
8/27/19, 4:31 PM - Shona 😍: It's several pages of terms
8/27/19, 4:32 PM - Shona 😍: Annual interest atm is 0,238%, it's dependent on Euribor
8/27/19, 4:34 PM - Shona 😍: 15 years to pay it back after graduation
8/27/19, 4:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅😅😅😛
8/27/19, 4:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wtf?!
8/27/19, 4:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's ridiculous
8/27/19, 4:34 PM - Shona 😍: At least what I understood
8/27/19, 4:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's all what I wanted to know
8/27/19, 4:34 PM - Shona 😍: Like that's the upper limit
8/27/19, 4:34 PM - Shona 😍: I think
8/27/19, 4:36 PM - Shona 😍: Okkapokka 😬

8/27/19, 4:48 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
8/27/19, 4:54 PM - Shona 😍: This is not urgent at all
8/27/19, 4:54 PM - Shona 😍: Just thought about it now with the loan
8/27/19, 4:54 PM - Shona 😍: #tbt

8/27/19, 4:59 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
8/27/19, 5:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
8/27/19, 5:22 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmm well here it's a lot for just an account
8/27/19, 5:23 PM - Shona 😍: And with that account it's also about government backing it up
8/27/19, 5:23 PM - Shona 😍: But sounds insane that it's so much more there 😳
8/27/19, 5:23 PM - Shona 😍: Though if that's the case I should get an account in India :P
8/27/19, 5:24 PM - Shona 😍: And it's the additional 4% that makes the biggest difference
8/27/19, 5:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking the same.
8/27/19, 5:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: True.
8/27/19, 5:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Discount on the loan for the house
8/27/19, 5:24 PM - Shona 😍: But that must be somehow... Restricted
8/27/19, 5:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Here the loan interest is 18%
8/27/19, 5:25 PM - Shona 😍: Otherwise everyone would be doing it
8/27/19, 5:25 PM - Shona 😍: What the actual fuck
8/27/19, 5:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. There are income tax checks for that. But nothing that you can't work around
8/27/19, 5:25 PM - Shona 😍: Lol
8/27/19, 5:25 PM - Shona 😍: Well we should really think this through
8/27/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: True.
8/27/19, 5:26 PM - Shona 😍: At some point
8/27/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The numbers are huge
8/27/19, 5:26 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
8/27/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If found a hack good enough
8/27/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Our savings interest might/will pay for our loan interest
8/27/19, 5:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅😛
8/27/19, 5:26 PM - Shona 😍: But also about the stability of the economy too? It must be different here and there
8/27/19, 5:27 PM - Shona 😍: The interests
8/27/19, 5:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: True. But I will have to educate myself on these topics
8/27/19, 5:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am really a dumb ass
8/27/19, 5:27 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
8/27/19, 5:27 PM - Shona 😍: Me too

8/28/19, 1:45 PM - Shona 😍: More when you increase weights
8/28/19, 1:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 1:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. Yeah more or less one min
8/28/19, 1:53 PM - Shona 😍: Putting your thumbs around the bar will help
8/28/19, 1:54 PM - Shona 😍: https://youtu.be/BYKScL2sgCs

Also this is good to watch before next time
8/28/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: Also maybe go a bit lighter
8/28/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: It's wobbling a bit
8/28/19, 1:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
8/28/19, 1:56 PM - Shona 😍: In the beginning it's most important to get the movement patterns right
8/28/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
8/28/19, 1:57 PM - Shona 😍: So that you don't create problems
8/28/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand
8/28/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did some cardio
8/28/19, 1:57 PM - Shona 😍: Hihi
8/28/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I got to know that cardio after lifting is better than cardio done before
8/28/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Omg
8/28/19, 1:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am almost dead
8/28/19, 1:57 PM - Shona 😍: I can imagine
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was doing alternate toe touches
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Got a head rush
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Could not get y head straight for 4 mins.
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: Yes, and best to do completely separately if possible
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: Huhhuh
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's not true.
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: Don't kill yourself there
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I read otherwise
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah I have a problem too
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Shona 😍: Well depends what's your goal
8/28/19, 1:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😛
8/28/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: With this
8/28/19, 1:59 PM - Shona 😍: If you want the most out of both, best to do separately
8/28/19, 2:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 2:02 PM - Shona 😍: Welcome to the world of strenght training 😄 that's what it is
8/28/19, 2:02 PM - Shona 😍: But kidding aside
8/28/19, 2:02 PM - Shona 😍: I would really recommend eating something after a bit
8/28/19, 2:03 PM - Shona 😍: You'll not feel as weak
8/28/19, 2:04 PM - Shona 😍: Also I checked again, your source (:P) was right, doing it right after is alright, not necessarily better than completely separate, for muscle growth
8/28/19, 2:05 PM - Shona 😍: Also wow you gonna be sore tomorrow
8/28/19, 2:07 PM - Shona 😍: But seriously any questions about these things, search his channel. Science backed advice on nutrition and muscle growth
8/28/19, 2:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am hungry
8/28/19, 2:08 PM - Shona 😍: Please eat
8/28/19, 2:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I know I will feel good
8/28/19, 2:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
8/28/19, 2:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know the more hungry I stay rn
8/28/19, 2:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The more i will burn
8/28/19, 2:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
8/28/19, 2:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Shona 😍: Well I think you'll be more efficient with work too if you eat something
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You want to kill me for this. Don't you?
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: True.
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Staying fit is the point
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not burning fat
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also work is more important
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Shona 😍: And for the muscle growth eating something is better
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Shona 😍: Exactly
8/28/19, 2:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You recommend eggs?
8/28/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: Don't make that the 1st priority
8/28/19, 2:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How many
8/28/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: I would recommend whey and carbs right after :P
8/28/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: Hmm
8/28/19, 2:10 PM - Shona 😍: Carbs help with recovery
8/28/19, 2:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Rice?
8/28/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: Well how many do you feel like having
8/28/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: 3?
8/28/19, 2:11 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah that's good

8/28/19, 2:22 PM - Shona 😍: I know!
8/28/19, 2:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also I don't feel like eating
8/28/19, 2:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Drank salty lemonade
8/28/19, 2:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And eggs
8/28/19, 2:22 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand
8/28/19, 2:22 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am done
8/28/19, 2:23 PM - Shona 😍: Okkapokka
8/28/19, 2:23 PM - Shona 😍: Don't force yourself now
8/28/19, 2:23 PM - Shona 😍: Eating later is also good
8/28/19, 2:24 PM - Shona 😍: Really good choice 👌🏼
8/28/19, 2:25 PM - Shona 😍: You really help me improve my attitude with getting things done and the decision making
8/28/19, 2:25 PM - Shona 😍: Like with the packing now
8/28/19, 2:25 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah I'm not done yet
8/28/19, 2:26 PM - Shona 😍: But without you I would've let it linger for so much longer
8/28/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I moved
8/28/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So the connection went bad
8/28/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just give yourself a target
8/28/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's 12 in the noon
8/28/19, 2:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Finish it by 3
8/28/19, 2:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should be enough
8/28/19, 2:51 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
8/28/19, 2:51 PM - Shona 😍: Ugh
8/28/19, 2:51 PM - Shona 😍: Sick of it
8/28/19, 2:52 PM - Shona 😍: Okay just the idea
8/28/19, 2:52 PM - Shona 😍: Actually doing it is not that bad
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sick of what?
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Shona 😍: The packingggggg
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Shona 😍: 🙄
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Shona 😍: 🤮
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can understand
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But is it because you are thinking too much?
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean holding everything in hand
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Thinking whether or not you need it
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
8/28/19, 2:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would suggest
8/28/19, 2:54 PM - Shona 😍: Exactly
8/28/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ask yourself this one question
8/28/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do I *absolutely* need it?
8/28/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's it. And the answer is a simple Yes and a No.
8/28/19, 2:54 PM - Shona 😍: Well then most of the stuff goes :P
8/28/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Most. But not all.
8/28/19, 2:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The point is
8/28/19, 2:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That most of the important stuff will automatically make it
8/28/19, 2:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For eg
8/28/19, 2:55 PM - Shona 😍: Also that is a judgement call
8/28/19, 2:55 PM - Shona 😍: Between need and want
8/28/19, 2:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 2:57 PM - Shona 😍: Kkkkkkkk

8/28/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
8/28/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It reminds me of an old man at the elephant village cursing someone over the phone
8/28/19, 3:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow, listen to someone else curse, can be really really fun
8/28/19, 4:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why so happy

8/28/19, 4:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I dont know how to solve this one for you
8/28/19, 4:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No advice seems to work from this far
8/28/19, 4:16 PM - Shona 😍: I think I'm gonna take a proper break
8/28/19, 4:16 PM - Shona 😍: That's what I used to do when I got stuck with studying
8/28/19, 4:16 PM - Shona 😍: Losing efficiency
8/28/19, 4:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I dont know what to say
8/28/19, 4:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sounds like a sensible thing to do

8/28/19, 6:36 PM - Shona 😍: As much as I could fit in them
8/28/19, 6:36 PM - Shona 😍: Gonna have to go a month without them though :/
8/28/19, 6:36 PM - Shona 😍: Are you at the machine learning thing now?
8/28/19, 6:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
8/28/19, 8:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How are
8/28/19, 8:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What are you doing
8/28/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am going to be offline for some time
8/28/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I haven't worked on the applications at all today
8/28/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
8/28/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to talk too
8/28/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So for that to happen I will finish everything
8/28/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then talk peacefully
8/28/19, 8:23 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am working at the office and
8/28/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will work until they go for dinner
8/28/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I ate already
8/28/19, 8:24 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the machine learning session was shit
8/28/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: I was eating with mum and dad
8/28/19, 8:29 PM - Shona 😍: Did some more packing
8/28/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: Absolutely fucking hate it atm
8/28/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: And omg I've been eating so much these past days 😅
8/28/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: Even though the food is boring
8/28/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe because of that
8/28/19, 8:30 PM - Shona 😍: Ugh
8/28/19, 8:31 PM - Shona 😍: Not liking Finland atm
8/28/19, 8:31 PM - Shona 😍: And I'm gonna get super fat if I keep eating like this
8/28/19, 8:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I will like that
8/28/19, 8:32 PM - Shona 😍: 😂😂😌
8/28/19, 8:33 PM - Shona 😍: But seriously?
8/28/19, 8:35 PM - Shona 😍: You have said that before but somehow I have serious trouble understanding it
8/28/19, 8:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But why? You like hefty guys
8/28/19, 8:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I like chubby women
8/28/19, 8:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't think there is any logic to it
8/28/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: I think for myself it's because I've always thought I look better when I'm thinner
8/28/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: Probably also the culture here
8/28/19, 8:37 PM - Shona 😍: And that was especially during the time I wanted to do modeling
8/28/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know. Who am I kidding
8/28/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I like to be thin myself
8/28/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But there is something very sexy about flabs to me
8/28/19, 8:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I just get hyper aroused
8/28/19, 8:38 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmmmmmmmm
8/28/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: But that also makes me curious
8/28/19, 8:40 PM - Shona 😍: Is that just you
8/28/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: Or is it a more common thing with guys there
8/28/19, 8:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why?
8/28/19, 8:41 PM - Shona 😍: I'm just trying to wrap my head around it
8/28/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: And apparently Fasu likes Laura better when she's heavier
8/28/19, 8:42 PM - Shona 😍: So I'm wondering if it's an eastern thing more
8/28/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: Though I have never had these conversations with western men either 🤔
8/28/19, 8:43 PM - Shona 😍: So what do I know
8/28/19, 8:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well Laura is pretty heavy inherself🤪
8/28/19, 9:07 PM - Shona 😍: But can you answer my question too :D
8/28/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And what would that b
8/28/19, 9:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *be
8/28/19, 9:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One more application done
8/28/19, 9:27 PM - Shona 😍: Wonderful ⭐

8/28/19, 9:32 PM - Shona 😍: And come here
8/28/19, 9:32 PM - Shona 😍: And be with me
8/28/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah

8/28/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking
8/28/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: how feasible will it be
8/28/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: to come there and learn to code
8/28/19, 9:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I seriously dont know how my mother will take it
8/28/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No idea whatsoever
8/28/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
8/28/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was just thinking
8/28/19, 9:34 PM - Shona 😍: You mean if you don't get a job?
8/28/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah
8/28/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am thinking
8/28/19, 9:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: that if this doesnt get me a job then I dont know what will
8/28/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: Well if they want more experience
8/28/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: I think that's the only thing
8/28/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: That might be it
8/28/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yead
8/28/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: Other than that
8/28/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *Yeah
8/28/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: You should get something
8/28/19, 9:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking the same
8/28/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: For real
8/28/19, 9:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What was it?
8/28/19, 9:47 PM - Shona 😍: This
8/28/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well I think it is.
8/28/19, 9:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At least in my talks with Faizal and other guys
8/28/19, 9:53 PM - Shona 😍: Seriously interesting
8/28/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 9:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why?
8/28/19, 9:55 PM - Shona 😍: Because it's opposite to what I've thought
8/28/19, 9:56 PM - Shona 😍: This the same than earlier?
8/28/19, 9:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: another random guy

8/29/19, 12:14 AM - Shona 😍: I don't think I could've slept here otherwise
8/29/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: Still feels super itchy in my nose
8/29/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: Also
8/29/19, 12:15 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know why I feel so tired these days
8/29/19, 12:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>

8/29/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
8/29/19, 1:21 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
8/29/19, 2:18 AM - Shona 😍: Oh god
8/29/19, 2:18 AM - Shona 😍: I just had chole again
8/29/19, 2:18 AM - Shona 😍: And remembered why am I alive
8/29/19, 2:18 AM - Shona 😍: To have food like that
8/29/19, 2:18 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah it was old
8/29/19, 2:18 AM - Shona 😍: But it hadn't gone bad
8/29/19, 2:19 AM - Shona 😍: And it was somehow really as satisfying
8/29/19, 2:19 AM - Shona 😍: With it being cooked properly
8/29/19, 2:19 AM - Shona 😍: With all the different spices
8/29/19, 2:21 AM - Shona 😍: And I remembered how in India I found the joy in eating again
8/29/19, 2:21 AM - Shona 😍: I don't know how to do it here
8/29/19, 2:21 AM - Shona 😍: I can only have such food if I cook it myself
8/29/19, 2:22 AM - Shona 😍: And I don't know if I will have the time
8/29/19, 2:22 AM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna have to make time though...
8/29/19, 2:22 AM - Shona 😍: Omh
8/29/19, 2:22 AM - Shona 😍: Omg*
8/29/19, 8:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. Good morning. I slept like a log. I just had a weird dream, a very weird dream in which I was robbing someone and evading the police. It was not a comfortable dream but I still feel very fresh. There was a crunch of space with 6 guys sleeping on 3 beds but it was definetly worth it as this was one of the best sleeps I have had in about 2 weeks. Other than that, I am getting started with the applications again. I will first write the Letter of Recommendation though. There is class that I have to attend at 11 and then lab at 2 and then class at 5. Other than that, today is the last day for me to fill the appications and I hope I am able to fill as many.
8/29/19, 9:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I miss you. In every which way the word can me. I miss being happy with you. I miss being surprised by you. I miss being miserable next to you as much as I miss being productive next to you. Everything was different when you were here. It seemed like life is slow and easy, but for me, at least rn, it's not. It is utterly fast-paced and nightmarish and somehow, these are the kind of courses that I cant even delay any further. These are offered only once every year so I have to do all of them now. I dont know why I am telling you all this. But yeah, I also dont know what else to say
8/29/19, 9:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I will try and say something positive.
8/29/19, 9:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I remember after Gurugram, I was so afraid of you leaving that I used to be sad almost all the time that I wasn't with you. That is the reason why we didn't go to the gym or to Agra. Simply because I just was very bummed when we had to devote time for anything else. I was very very very very scared of you leaving. Remember last semester when I could feel the palpitations when I woke up in the mornings? Every day I used to feel those palpitations without you and then I used to rush to GH1. Spend the whole day with you and then realize oh yes, this is how I want to spend my time with you, just by being next to you. On top of that, the train rides and the greenry of the village made me feel that our lives in the city are too fast paced and all that we care about now is the effeciency and we dont care anything about what we actually like. BUt now I know what we like and that is:
8/29/19, 9:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 1. Good food
2. Scooty rides
3. Lush green landscapes or just beautiful landscapes
4. just being next to  each other and not doing anything
5. Working out together
6. Of course, good food
add more items you think we like...
8/29/19, 9:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that somehow makes me think that it will be very nice to have a modern farmhouse in Finland or in India. Which has a glass window that looks outside to a greenfield as far as you can see, in which we just lie next to each other, read books, work out? So, it has a mini gym. There are frisbees to play with. There is a dog- or many stray dogs if it is in India- and we play with him as well. There is a bike and a scooter and we drive around in the village on it and help people in their sickness. they tell me their disease and I translate it for you. Or if we are in Finland then we go around helping old people in things like cleaning their house or lawn or something. Every day we get fresh vegetables and we try different recipes and I make food for you with those. I don't know when I will have that with you but just so that we are on the same page, this is what I am aiming for.
8/29/19, 9:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, coming back to what you said earlier as to how you liked the food and how you would like to have that again. I think you will have that very soon. Very very soon because food always tastes good in company and I am sure you will find some foodie there. Also, I think when you say you liked the food, I am guessing a major part of it was me orgasming over it and giving you those expressions like I just came in my panties. O god panties, your smelly panties. FOCUS KUNJ. Yeah, so I was saying, a major part of it was me selling it to you. Of course, the food was nice on its own but you can't deny how wonderful it was to have it together. I think more than the taste you miss the fulfilment. And all I can say is don't. Seriously, don't. It will all be fine. I will be there as soon as I can and then we will have that every weekend.  I will take a bus to Kuopio every weekend and I will be in your arms. While on my way, I will ask you to cook food and then we will have it together when I come. Also, I think its a very good thing that I am not there for sometime when you start college. I think it will be a very good period for you to start making friends. Because obviously if I was there then won't work on those things. So please don't feel bad. It is a blessing in disguise.
8/29/19, 9:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Again, a very good morning and have a great day ahead!
8/29/19, 9:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 9:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is very cute
8/29/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The good news is that I have to write 4 more applications. I checked out all the indeed jobs and they are pretty much the same on Linkedin or demand experience. Both of which, I don't have, so I just dismissed many. Left with 2 of those. 2 more applications at Macquarie and then I will be done. Planning to finish all of it by tonight. And then aphew. I will be done with this tiring process
8/29/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then the real game starts for placement preparation
8/29/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
8/29/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning darling
8/29/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mera shona
8/29/19, 11:37 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Mera pyaara baby
8/29/19, 11:38 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning rakas
8/29/19, 11:44 AM - Shona 😍: I feel miserable without you next to me
8/29/19, 11:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nooooo. Don't say that.
8/29/19, 11:52 AM - Shona 😍: I just remember the one time in the last days in Kanpur when I was feeling anxious and restless and I didn't know what was wrong. I said I feel like crying and then you tried told me to come lie next to you. After I did, I started crying and then we just lay there, I was hugging you, your arms around me and me smelling your neck. And I was all fine after that. Then we had sex after that and that was great. All that completely changed how I was feeling then, the restlesness was gone.
8/29/19, 11:52 AM - Shona 😍: I'm just scared to go
8/29/19, 11:52 AM - Shona 😍: Also excited
8/29/19, 11:52 AM - Shona 😍: But nervous too
8/29/19, 11:53 AM - Shona 😍: And I just wish I could hug you for it to go away
8/29/19, 12:01 PM - Shona 😍: I was feeling some of this in my sleep too, though the nervousness was about something else. And I just remembered that in my dream there was a dog that I patted, and I felt better. I'm not sure if it was Nelli or some other dog. It was about the same size as she was
8/29/19, 12:03 PM - Shona 😍: I'm so glad you got good sleep
8/29/19, 12:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I really wish I was there to get a dog with you
8/29/19, 12:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I always feel like gifting you one
8/29/19, 12:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
8/29/19, 12:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know it's not my decision to make
8/29/19, 12:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But somehow I feel that you are not giving it proper thought
8/29/19, 12:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please think about it and let me know
8/29/19, 12:05 PM - Shona 😍: I do not have the money for it now
8/29/19, 12:06 PM - Shona 😍: And it would need to be alone too much during the day when I'm at the uni
8/29/19, 12:06 PM - Shona 😍: It is very expensive here
8/29/19, 12:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah I get it
8/29/19, 12:09 PM - Shona 😍: I really miss the slowness. This week has not been that at all for me either. First I really liked being productive and getting things done and rushing with everything. Drinking lots of coffee and sleeping less. But yesterday I felt absolutely horrible most of the day.
8/29/19, 12:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry for saying it again and again
8/29/19, 12:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But this is how I feel
8/29/19, 12:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well, nothing is stopping you from being slow now. Go be slow. Just fucking lie there. Don't do anything.
8/29/19, 12:10 PM - Shona 😍: And I feel like going through this would be so much easier if I was with you
8/29/19, 12:10 PM - Shona 😍: We could be productive together
8/29/19, 12:11 PM - Shona 😍: But also take breaks together and be with each other
8/29/19, 12:12 PM - Shona 😍: It's just that I haven't even had time to properly think about what happened in India
8/29/19, 12:12 PM - Shona 😍: And now I'm so focused on what is to come next week
8/29/19, 12:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. You don't have to be. I mean don't try to control it. Let it go. Let it all come to you. Lie there and type whatever comes to your mind
8/29/19, 12:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or send audio notes
8/29/19, 12:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You have the whole day for that.

8/29/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Its hard baby
8/29/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When you are neglected in a family for all you ur life
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And when you have to play judge and jury between all fights
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And when nobody in your family ever says that they are proud of you
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's hard.
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You just feel that you are a nobody.
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry. I really am.
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: But still why
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am slowly getting it
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You trying to sleep in the office was an eye opener
8/29/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: Do you not understand what you are to me

8/29/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Explain it. It's hard. You seldom talk like this.
8/29/19, 11:15 PM - Shona 😍: I will not sleep
8/29/19, 11:15 PM - Shona 😍: But I will stay the night
8/29/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah yeah. Thats not the point
8/29/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The point is that you tried
8/29/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You always give up your comfort to be with me
8/29/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok. I can't complete Macquarie applications today. And also I can't complete Relex's application today and not even F-secure. The referral was not an internal referral so not the Macquarie applications. Similarly F-secure needs a video. I need formals for that. Relex needs the letter of recommendation that Varun will send me tomorrow. So I can't do any of those. But yeah. They shouldn't take much time
8/29/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: Okeiiokeii
8/29/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: Hyvä poics
8/29/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: Poica
8/29/19, 11:22 PM - Shona 😍: I don't think there are words that qre to enough to explain it. It has to be the sleeping-on-the-floor-with-bugs -moments that tell it
8/29/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah. I get it.
8/29/19, 11:25 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
8/29/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: I love you
8/29/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: I want to kiss you now
8/29/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: On your cute cute cheeks
8/29/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: And forehead
8/29/19, 11:25 PM - Shona 😍: And lips
8/29/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby. I am going to be offline for a while. I have work to finish. You can send me messages and audio notes.

8/29/19, 11:30 PM - Shona 😍: I hope it will some day mean enough for you
8/29/19, 11:30 PM - Shona 😍: That I think that
8/30/19, 12:08 AM - Shona 😍: But why have you done that? What's been your motivation? What exactly have you felt when you have done it?
8/30/19, 12:17 AM - Shona 😍: Did you do this?
8/30/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah. Mom is here.

8/30/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And were having an open mind.
8/30/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So that was good
8/30/19, 12:54 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
8/30/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I explained them my primary side
8/30/19, 12:54 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
8/30/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And told them
8/30/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That job satisfaction is of utmost importance to me
8/30/19, 12:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And nothing else matters

8/30/19, 1:53 AM - Shona 😍: Well you've been very productive on the past days
8/30/19, 1:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel or I suspect it is the feeling of thinking that I dont deserve the besta and feeling inadequate somehow

8/30/19, 1:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I dont know if grinding myself is good
8/30/19, 1:57 AM - Shona 😍: Overdoing it is not
8/30/19, 1:57 AM - Shona 😍: It's already 2 there

8/30/19, 2:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If i am not talking you can still send me your thoughts
8/30/19, 2:03 AM - Shona 😍: I

8/30/19, 2:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: and you were drunk

8/30/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: Well usually I'm being productive
8/30/19, 2:04 AM - Shona 😍: If not drunk

8/30/19, 2:05 AM - Shona 😍: Again I'm not talking enough

8/30/19, 2:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That send me more Audio notes
8/30/19, 2:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You always are so sensible when sobor
8/30/19, 2:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like you kept saying sorry even today
8/30/19, 2:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When sending the voice notes
8/30/19, 2:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All I am saying is that you can be silly
8/30/19, 2:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can be yourself
8/30/19, 2:08 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are not disturbing if you are sending notes
8/30/19, 2:09 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There is no point in being so dramatic
8/30/19, 2:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just saying what I feel
8/30/19, 2:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I am wrong
8/30/19, 2:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But there is no reason to feel bad.
8/30/19, 2:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yeah I am not talking about today. I am talking about these days
8/30/19, 2:12 AM - Shona 😍: Well I have hated the past days
8/30/19, 2:12 AM - Shona 😍: And you've been working
8/30/19, 2:12 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I would want to know that. More about it.
8/30/19, 2:13 AM - Shona 😍: So I didn't want to disturb you
8/30/19, 2:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It doesn't matter. A more one sided conversation can happen
8/30/19, 2:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's what I am saying
8/30/19, 2:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It won't disturb me
8/30/19, 2:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will reply when I can
8/30/19, 2:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will still want to know those thoughts
8/30/19, 2:13 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And also that's a very very shitty logic
8/30/19, 2:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't get messages when I am productive and I don't message when you are
8/30/19, 2:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that will be our doom
8/30/19, 2:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is a conversation supposed to happen then
8/30/19, 2:14 AM - Shona 😍: For heaven's sake
8/30/19, 2:14 AM - Shona 😍: I did talk today
8/30/19, 2:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Remember when you used to study I used to send so many messages and then you used to reply to all those on your way back on the bus
8/30/19, 2:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
8/30/19, 2:15 AM - Shona 😍: Uhhuh
8/30/19, 2:16 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 2:17 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 2:18 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 2:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And you think you weren't complaining today?
8/30/19, 2:19 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course you were. But the point is that those are also the kind of thoughts I want to know.
8/30/19, 2:20 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 2:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not that I only want filtered thoughts.
8/30/19, 2:20 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 2:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't want to argue
8/30/19, 2:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will say my point one more time
8/30/19, 2:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In a concise manner
8/30/19, 2:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think, we are both going to be busy in the upcoming days and years. We will live in our work modes and different time zones etc. If we both think that we can't message the other person because that will distract them then I think we will never talk. What we can do is message each other and the other person can put the phone on silent and read the messages later without getting distracted.
8/30/19, 2:25 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 2:31 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: On the same position, I would like to say, I can enjoy more messages from you. Yeah, I want to listen to everything you say and that too complaints but remember how you were showing me things when you were packing. Similarly when you go about doing things in your day, don't you want to share more? Like you told me how you destroyed a batch of laundry and how you used the extra Chocolate to make cookies. I really feel like I am a part of your life when you do that. It is amazing how much these little things mean to both of us. I try and tell you everything about me, I know you have started doing the same, but the thing is that you feel it is perfectly normal to avoid doing that when you are in your work mode but is it? Isn't it just being stubborn about a bad attitude. Remember we are in a long distance relationship so we will have to be pro active in our efforts to find such solutions.
8/30/19, 2:33 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 2:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hey
8/30/19, 2:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: There won't be a different problem

8/31/19, 11:32 PM - Shona 😍: It's not the same thing
8/31/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it is
8/31/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's nice
8/31/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Isn't it?
8/31/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am talking to a friend about placements
8/31/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So don't feel neglected please
8/31/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also if you do
8/31/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You should have pointed ouy
8/31/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *out
8/31/19, 11:36 PM - Shona 😍: No
8/31/19, 11:36 PM - Shona 😍: I don't feel like talking much on text
8/31/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sure.
8/31/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let's talk later then
8/31/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: 👍🏼
8/31/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
8/31/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know what that means Kolehmainen
8/31/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So.
8/31/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ✌🏻
8/31/19, 11:41 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna cook now
8/31/19, 11:42 PM - Shona 😍: It's gonna take me a while to explain what I think about this
8/31/19, 11:43 PM - Shona 😍: I need to understand it first myself
8/31/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: Firstly I don't like it when you group me together with someone else in your life, like I'm no special,  even if it's your mum
8/31/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: I understand that she's upset about this
8/31/19, 11:54 PM - Shona 😍: But it doesn't sound promising if we can't talk in the weekends.
8/31/19, 11:56 PM - Shona 😍: And I know that's not true, I know I am special to you, but that's what putting it like you did implied. That the same goes for me and her
9/1/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: Again, I understand she's having difficulty with this and it stresses her out. I get it. I just don't like the situation that we can't talk because of that, so I expressed my dissatisfaction with that. I just moved to a new city and new house and I would've wanted to share many things with you and actually see you and talk to like a human being. Even though it's quite far from that anyway because the best we get is the video. I don't wanna complain about that again but that's just how it is. So these additional obstacles don't make it any easier.
9/1/19, 1:11 AM - Shona 😍: Baby I'm sorry if I was being rude
9/1/19, 1:11 AM - Shona 😍: I made dahl for dinner
9/1/19, 1:11 AM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 1:11 AM - Shona 😍: I'm having it with curd and flat bread
9/1/19, 1:12 AM - Shona 😍: I made a huge pot 😅😅😅
9/1/19, 1:12 AM - Shona 😍: Gonna eat it for a week now
9/1/19, 1:13 AM - Shona 😍: I didn't mean to be, I was just really bummed I couldn't talk with you
9/1/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: This is insanely good
9/1/19, 1:15 AM - Shona 😍: I used the spices
9/1/19, 1:30 AM - Shona 😍: Easily the best meal I've had since coming back to Finlad
9/1/19, 3:15 AM - Shona 😍: Good night
9/1/19, 10:05 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Easily? So the cchole didnt come close? :p
9/1/19, 10:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You were not being rude, you were being stubborn, most importantly you were being something that I don't expect from you. Remember how I always say that you are kind and considerate and I always give the example of the child you helped in the mall outside Subway? Back then and maybe unconsciously I just took it for a trait of yours and I thought that if it comes to a matter of your preference and someone else's discomfort, to cater to their problems. For eg, I remember that on that day we had gone out to eat for the first time after studying at the library and we were very hungry and almost soaked ourself, we really were enjoying each other's company and were about to leave for...... I don't know where but then you spoke to the girl and made sure she was ok. My mother is no exception, on top of that, she is not even mine anymore, she is our mother, if she has any objection with something then I sincerely feel that we should put up with her. For eg, one day Jari was not comfortable with me coming to home because he didn't wants strangers in the house, so I had to go, or I don't know, maybe you dropped me to Espoo. To me, that seemed unreasonable, but why did we put up with him, because we both know that is how he is. To a stranger, it may seem odd but then we both know it's his personality. Similarly, my mom is new to this. She has known about my past relationships but only when they have ended. Now she is a part of one that is going on rn.  Honestly, the fact that she is trying to understand is a huge leap from how I know her. ANd you know that from your days in Kanpur. In the past two days, she has even tried smiling about it and joke a bit too. But that doesn't give me the license to rush her with new things that she doesn't like, for eg, talking on the phone at night. It's not just you, even if I was to talk to my friends at night, she will simply scold me for using the phone at night, she thinks it is unhealthy and that it disturbs my sleep. It's just that if she sees me talking to a girl at night then she has difficulty sleeping and you know I don't want that for anyone. 
Besides this, you went to the house and slept and then went shopping, maybe we could have talked at that time or maybe not. I am just saying, you made your decision and then I had to compromise. I am sorry that it was that way but it had to be the way it was in the night. I was super tired and was dragging myself from here and there. Could have easily slept at 9 tried to stay awake to talk to you on text but then you said no. 
To this long message, all I am saying is, that where its a matter of your preference, it could be a difference of 40 points in someone else's BP. of course there has to be a limit to what people demand and how much my mother can ask of us but this is just the start of a very long journey so I try to be less stubborn.
And no, you were not being rude, you were expressing your discomfort. And that is good, I encourage you to. Maybe you were hangry as well. I was tired. We could not have talked anyways.
9/1/19, 11:42 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
9/1/19, 11:58 AM - Shona 😍: Thank you for explaining it in that much detail. I can understand better now. I haven't quite understood how she's felt about it and how difficult it must be for her. I'm sorry I was being stubborn and unreasonable. I was hangry, yes, but I think most importantly just overwhelmed by coming to Kuopio. I know these times are far from easy for you too. You work really hard, trying to find a balance between the classes, quizzes, applications, placement prep, gym, long distance relationship and your mother being uncomfortable with it. On top of that sleeping is an issue because it's so hot. Anyone could go crazy for all that. But you just keep going and that's amazing. I'm sorry that yesterday it was more like I added to your worries and I wasn't there to support you.
9/1/19, 12:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You were there. Don't worry. We will talk today. Good morning.
9/1/19, 12:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby, I still can't believe how far we have come, how much you have achieved in this one year. You are going to officialy start your studies tomorrow. For being a doctor! How can you! how could you! YOU ARE AMAZING! you are going to go to your college today to get the atlas how cool is that. You are going to get it from the college! Your college! OMG! I am so excited for you!!!!!! You are so darn lucky and happy! I seriously wish I was there with you to rejoice in that happiness. Anyways I am right here next to you! You can call me anytime you need me. Maa is very cool about our relationship now. Although, I am beware but I can at least talk. Also, I realized that it is the shitty internet that is preventing me from talking to you. I think thats a bad attitude and a very bad reason. I will try to work on that. Also, I wanted to tell you that I have lost 1.5 kgs in the past 4 days :) My posture has improved and my sleep quality has improved a lot. I am simply amazed. I also feel much accomplished and I have also decided to take the Sundays off. No matter what! The work is a lot and yeah, since nothing is going to be enough, I can't give my life to it. I simply can't. I am going to take the Sundays off unless something urgent comes up. Or yeah maybe I can do some work. Maybe two hours but I dont have to stress about it.

9/2/19, 4:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In the app you sent me when you put in the weight of how much you lifted. Do you type the weight of the plate that you used or double that or the total weight of plates and barbell. For eg, when I am putting in the weight let's say I used 20kg plates. So how much weight should I put in in the app? 20? 40? Or 20*2+20(for barbell)?
9/2/19, 4:54 PM - Shona 😍: You can choose, just keep it constant that you know it yourself. I put the total weight, bar + plates

9/4/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Okka
9/4/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Yes.......
9/4/19, 10:48 PM - Shona 😍: Well I think these are the more common problems that Finns deal with
9/4/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: Being super introverted and closed
9/4/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe channelling that to a drinking problem or something else
9/4/19, 10:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And it's quite ironical that you guys rate yourself as the happiest nation
9/4/19, 10:49 PM - Shona 😍: It really is
9/4/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: But I think it's getting better
9/4/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: At least the culture is changing
9/4/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have a plan for you to invade your father's space
9/4/19, 10:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you will have to work hard.
9/4/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: Like it's getting acceptable and encouraged for boys and men to talk about feelings too
9/4/19, 10:50 PM - Shona 😍: It didn't used to be like that
9/4/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it was not before this?
9/4/19, 10:51 PM - Shona 😍: And that plays a role
9/4/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: ☹
9/4/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand
9/4/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I never saw my father cry
9/4/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Except when my grandma died
9/4/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Even when mother used to beat him
9/4/19, 10:52 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe it's been similar all over the world then
9/4/19, 10:52 PM - Shona 😍: To some extent at least
9/4/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah. Spanish men can't hold it
9/4/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I guess

9/4/19, 11:02 PM - Shona 😍: We can use my student loan
9/4/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: If you don't get a job
9/4/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: But let's hope you will
9/4/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will
9/4/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was thinking about it
9/4/19, 11:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that won't be too smart
9/4/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And Mom will never agree
9/4/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So getting a job and going is the only way
9/4/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because it is too short term
9/4/19, 11:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know emotions have no rationale
9/4/19, 11:07 PM - Shona 😍: Does it need to be?
9/4/19, 11:08 PM - Shona 😍: We could try it for a little while
9/4/19, 11:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But we just spent 3000 euros of yours and at least 1500 of mine

9/4/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Other than that I was good to go
9/4/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: That I knew
9/4/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow I never mentioned it myself
9/4/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: I didn't know about the rest
9/4/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Never mind
9/4/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now we know.

9/4/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: I'm kidding 100%
9/4/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then kissing your neck
9/4/19, 11:26 PM - Shona 😍: I'm way too tired to get annoyed
9/4/19, 11:26 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then feeling you melt

9/6/19, 1:09 PM - Shona 😍: And the weather is supposed to be horrible and mostly there's room on the deck in open air
9/6/19, 1:09 PM - Shona 😍: But mainly because of this
9/6/19, 1:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can

9/6/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was the usual
9/6/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tedious
9/6/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Cumbersome
9/6/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And boring
9/6/19, 5:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi

9/6/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: Also please don't go to the gym today then!!

9/6/19, 5:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel like being selfish and asking you to stay back and talk but before you started college and even before we started this relationship I made it a point to myself that I won't kill my partner's social life. So I won't ask you to. You can decide freely and I will be supportive
9/6/19, 6:03 PM - Shona 😍: Oh!!!!
9/6/19, 6:09 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>

9/6/19, 6:18 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/6/19, 6:18 PM - Shona 😍: It is hard
9/6/19, 6:18 PM - Shona 😍: Very hard
9/6/19, 6:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You will have to say more. Abstract ways of conveying ideas don't help when we haven't talked in a while
9/6/19, 6:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ihana
9/6/19, 6:21 PM - Shona 😍: I will
9/6/19, 6:22 PM - Shona 😍: I also wish that you talk more

9/6/19, 6:26 PM - Shona 😍: ❤
9/6/19, 6:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I found an ingenious hack for my phone
9/6/19, 6:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: To use it less.
9/6/19, 6:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is such a great one.
9/6/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The hack is
9/6/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That just turn your phone's screen black and white
9/6/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It will seem so useless
9/6/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you will stop using it
9/6/19, 6:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The word priority came into the English language in the 1400s. It was singular. It meant the very first or prior thing. It stayed singular for the next five hundred years. Only in the 1900s did we pluralise the term and start talking about priorities. Illogically, we reasoned that by changing the word we could bend reality. Somehow we would now be able to have multiple “first”things. People and companies routinely try to do just that. One leader told me of his experience in a company that talked of “Pri-1, Pri-2, Pri-3, Pri-4, and Pri-5.”This gave the impression of many things being the priority but actually meant nothing was.
9/6/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: Does it work?
9/6/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: Where did you learn that?
9/6/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: Also I'm done with cooking

9/6/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am working on my stuff in a personalized manner
9/6/19, 10:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like how much do I like Kurtas
9/6/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Will I be giving them up for no reason at all
9/6/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or like do I want to have them
9/6/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I get the idea
9/6/19, 10:52 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah that's the point? Like you can customize it
9/6/19, 10:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Get rid of the redundant
9/6/19, 10:53 PM - Shona 😍: Which kinda clothes you like wearing

Good to Haves:

Caveats:
You will want to buy colors
you will want to buy kurtas
you will want to buy in sale
You will want to buy when you feel bored
When you go to a mall to shop for someone else, you will want to buy stuff
9/6/19, 10:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I can create
9/6/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: rules plans and scoreboards to make myself go about it in a logical manner
9/6/19, 10:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe it is time and effort wasted but sounds really cool
9/6/19, 10:59 PM - Shona 😍: It does
9/6/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: And I think thinking this through and making a plan helps
9/6/19, 11:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Making a plan about making a plan?
9/6/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: And I can help keeping you accountable
9/6/19, 11:00 PM - Shona 😍: Hehehe
9/6/19, 11:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For?
9/6/19, 11:01 PM - Shona 😍: Not buying more clothes
9/6/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I dont think I plan to do it
9/6/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It generally is a snap judgement
9/6/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: but yeah I guess putting something on the line works
9/6/19, 11:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: for eg
9/6/19, 11:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: if I do it then I have to give something up
9/6/19, 11:02 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/6/19, 11:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: SO that when I am about to do it I remember what I am giving up
9/6/19, 11:03 PM - Shona 😍: Exactly
9/6/19, 11:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What should I put?
9/6/19, 11:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Something near and dear to me?
9/6/19, 11:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: YOu?
9/6/19, 11:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: nah
9/6/19, 11:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: too big

9/6/19, 11:04 PM - Shona 😍: 🙄
9/6/19, 11:04 PM - Shona 😍: 🙄🙄🙄
9/6/19, 11:05 PM - Shona 😍: You need to give up another piece of clothing that you already have
9/6/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Or something similar to what you're about to buy
9/6/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Or will that help
9/6/19, 11:06 PM - Shona 😍: Or will you just keep switching it up constantly then
9/6/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes
9/6/19, 11:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I guess so
9/6/19, 11:10 PM - Shona 😍: 🤔
9/6/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am seriously trying to mamke a sytem in which I use a methodical approach which is rationale driven so that it helps me sort through the past and look for the future choices
9/6/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: for eg this is something that I think will help me develop a score and rate all my clothes and get rid of the
9/6/19, 11:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *them
9/6/19, 11:12 PM - Shona 😍: Did you read this?
9/6/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: yes
9/6/19, 11:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: i did
9/6/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: it was a very woman focused article
9/6/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: But can't you apply it just the same?
9/6/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: The categories
9/6/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: After that I read this
9/6/19, 11:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/
9/6/19, 11:13 PM - Shona 😍: The deciding factors like fit and comfyness and looks
9/6/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: nooooooooo
9/6/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You killed my creativity
9/6/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: !!!!
9/6/19, 11:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean its not your fault but
9/6/19, 11:14 PM - Shona 😍: Wat
9/6/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>
9/6/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is a sample image
9/6/19, 11:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I think you get the idea
9/6/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: rate the cloth on each of these parameters from 1 to 10
9/6/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: then make a threshold level and then just get rid of anything below the threshold
9/6/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: hihi
9/6/19, 11:16 PM - Shona 😍: Accha
9/6/19, 11:16 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I stretched it too far but i like it
9/6/19, 11:16 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds good
9/6/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I think many categories and subcategories can be added
9/6/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: But is that overcomplicating it
9/6/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: It doesn't need to be perfect
9/6/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: It can't be
9/6/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No.. I think not.
9/6/19, 11:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah yeah
9/6/19, 11:17 PM - Shona 😍: Just something that works
9/6/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: SO it has to be a rough working model
9/6/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: and then it can be perfected
9/6/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See
9/6/19, 11:18 PM - Shona 😍: And that you can actually get started with the process
9/6/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: the point is
9/6/19, 11:18 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/6/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to enjoy the process too
9/6/19, 11:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: the whole thing doesnt have to be a task
9/6/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I want to look back and do something so neat that the next time I do it, I can always look back and feel proud
9/6/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: also. This will be very design friendly
9/6/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: and a very nerdy thing to d
9/6/19, 11:19 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *do
9/6/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: but I think it will be very interesting to see what comes out of it
9/6/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: I understand
9/6/19, 11:20 PM - Shona 😍: Baby
9/6/19, 11:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: An bare bones model would be an excel sheet but a perfect solution would be an app

9/6/19, 11:28 PM - Shona 😍: But I took a lot of ideas from the article

9/6/19, 11:34 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/6/19, 11:35 PM - Shona 😍: Also because you have so many other things to work on in this time
9/6/19, 11:35 PM - Shona 😍: Don't get too hung up on the details with this

9/6/19, 11:35 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Waking up
9/6/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know it was an overkill
9/6/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
9/6/19, 11:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wanted to
9/6/19, 11:59 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow you seem to be in an interesting phase
9/6/19, 11:59 PM - Shona 😍: Or mood
9/6/19, 11:59 PM - Shona 😍: No mood seems like an understatement
9/7/19, 12:00 AM - Shona 😍: But thinking and wanting to change all these things

9/7/19, 7:02 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, it kind of feels nice to text you just after waking up
9/7/19, 7:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Feels like you live in my time zone
9/7/19, 7:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Try sleep meditation please?

9/7/19, 7:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh
9/7/19, 7:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
9/7/19, 10:11 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning. I am thinking about working with Rushikesh on his startup as a co-founder given he accepts my offer for 20% stake. This is just a passing thought and will need a lot of thinking. 
I am currently working on the Flipkart ppt but it struck me as an idea last night. He currently needs a business development officer who can give him the platform to showcase himself. He is very technical and can lead his side of things and I think I am able enough to handle the business side. I will have to see what he thinks about that.
9/7/19, 10:24 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning
9/7/19, 10:24 AM - Shona 😍: !!!
9/7/19, 10:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah yeah
9/7/19, 10:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know
9/7/19, 10:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: As I said
9/7/19, 10:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just thinking
9/7/19, 10:34 AM - Shona 😍: Did he say he's looking for someone to be that?
9/7/19, 10:35 AM - Shona 😍: Or you noticed he needs it
9/7/19, 10:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I see the need that he doesn't
9/7/19, 10:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then it's about pitching it the right way
9/7/19, 10:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At the right minute
9/7/19, 10:35 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/7/19, 10:36 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
9/7/19, 10:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me know your thoughts
9/7/19, 10:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Obviously that's a big decision
9/7/19, 10:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am also thinking that I don't like their way of working at all
9/7/19, 10:41 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So how will that work
9/7/19, 10:41 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/7/19, 10:42 AM - Shona 😍: Well can you tell me more about the startup
9/7/19, 10:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's a drone startup
9/7/19, 10:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you know
9/7/19, 10:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It aims at solutions based on the drone technology
9/7/19, 10:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Solutions like
9/7/19, 10:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Deliver of food
9/7/19, 10:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Medicines
9/7/19, 10:48 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or even Amazon packages
9/7/19, 10:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The thing is that rn India is an emerging market for drones because some startups in the space are making millions in dollars because of lack of competition
9/7/19, 10:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And what Rushikesh does, he does well, he is no master coder but he is a master fabricator and does the job well.
9/7/19, 10:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
9/7/19, 10:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And he has good ties in the industry
9/7/19, 10:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
9/7/19, 10:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Network+opportunity+talent, hence an open sky. All that he needs is a platform and direction to launch himself
9/7/19, 10:50 AM - Shona 😍: I see
9/7/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I am just infatuated
9/7/19, 10:53 AM - Shona 😍: You mean now that they won the competition?
9/7/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah
9/7/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's like when I see an opportunity
9/7/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or I crush over something
9/7/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's very hard to see the negatives
9/7/19, 10:56 AM - Shona 😍: Do you think you would like working with them and in that position you're thinking?
9/7/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think yes. I like being the front face of a company and I think I have the skills
9/7/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The work I will like
9/7/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The fact that I will stay away from you
9/7/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe that I will not
9/7/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd most importantly what I will not like is their working patter
9/7/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *pattern
9/7/19, 10:59 AM - Shona 😍: You mean the schedule?
9/7/19, 10:59 AM - Shona 😍: Or something else too
9/7/19, 10:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Working as a co-founder means being in charge and I don't think in my company I can withstand the way they work
9/7/19, 10:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Like last minute completions
9/7/19, 10:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The mentality
9/7/19, 10:59 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The quality of work
9/7/19, 11:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Basically it is the casual attitude
9/7/19, 11:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I like professionalism and nuances and attention to detail
9/7/19, 11:01 AM - Shona 😍: Well maybe they would benefit from someone who can bring that to the startup
9/7/19, 11:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Going this route also means that I will build a life for me here in India at least for a few years and you will be there in Kuopio anyway
9/7/19, 11:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They have to think it that way
9/7/19, 11:01 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah
9/7/19, 11:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: .
9/7/19, 11:04 AM - Shona 😍: I understand
9/7/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Stop being so uptight
9/7/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can let it out if you are feeling left out or something
9/7/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to be reasonable
9/7/19, 11:13 AM - Shona 😍: But my first reaction is being reasonable
9/7/19, 11:14 AM - Shona 😍: Of course I hate the idea of you not coming here asap
9/7/19, 11:14 AM - Shona 😍: But we can't only think about what we feel
9/7/19, 11:17 AM - Shona 😍: We need to consider the different options and their pros and cons
9/7/19, 11:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Would you want to talk? I am taking a break
9/7/19, 11:19 AM - Shona 😍: Yesssq
9/7/19, 12:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Forgot the charger at home

9/8/19, 12:31 AM - Shona 😍: 👀
9/8/19, 12:32 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm I need to hang some laundry
9/8/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
9/8/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hang it
9/8/19, 12:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: “The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own …” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.5.4–5 The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather—no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make someone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not spent on the things we can change. The recovery community practices something called the Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” Addicts cannot change the abuse suffered in childhood. They cannot undo the choices they have made or the hurt they have caused. But they can change the future—through the power they have in the present moment. As Epictetus said, they can control the choices they make right now. The same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.

9/8/19, 1:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My gym today was very very inspiring for me
9/8/19, 1:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not because I lifted so much in squats
9/8/19, 1:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But because I was able to do 17.5 kg in triceps

9/8/19, 1:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That when I got my second surgery done

9/8/19, 1:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I felt paralysed

9/8/19, 5:50 PM - Shona 😍: We have got each other so expensive gifts in the past
9/8/19, 5:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I was thinking that money spent on the vibrator is a long term investment as I am generally not able to make you come so even when we meet I would like to use it

9/8/19, 5:50 PM - Shona 😍: True

9/8/19, 5:51 PM - Shona 😍: But that's not fair
9/8/19, 5:52 PM - Shona 😍: Then we should get something similar for you as well...
9/8/19, 5:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Isn't you speaking Russian enough?

9/8/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know what to say then
9/8/19, 5:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah it is unfair

9/8/19, 5:57 PM - Shona 😍: And also later
9/8/19, 5:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exac
9/8/19, 5:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *exactly
9/8/19, 5:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is why I am thinking it's a long investment
9/8/19, 5:58 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah

9/9/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: And this is exactly what it feels like when you're in a bad mood and someone tells you not to react to it
9/9/19, 12:26 AM - Shona 😍: It pisses you the hell off 100x more
9/9/19, 12:58 AM - Shona 😍: I honestly thought you'd never do this to me
9/9/19, 12:59 AM - Shona 😍: But apparently I was wrong
9/9/19, 9:44 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning
9/9/19, 9:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slept more than 9 hpurs
9/9/19, 10:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you get the tickets?
9/9/19, 11:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did you sleep?
9/9/19, 11:07 AM - Shona 😍: So now you're talking to me?
9/9/19, 11:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am trying
9/9/19, 11:21 AM - Shona 😍: Go to hell
9/9/19, 11:47 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: A) you are equally wrong
B) you shouldn't have said that
C) both of us will regret it🙃
9/9/19, 11:48 AM - Shona 😍: You fucking cut the calla
9/9/19, 11:48 AM - Shona 😍: Call
9/9/19, 11:48 AM - Shona 😍: And left
9/9/19, 11:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And my dearest you did the same when I watched porn in May?
9/9/19, 11:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How is that different?
9/9/19, 11:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *April
9/9/19, 11:49 AM - Shona 😍: Oh so what exactly did I do yesterday that was so bad?
9/9/19, 11:50 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Its not about the level of bad. It's commiting the act of hanging up abruptly
9/9/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: I disagree
9/9/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: Let's talk later
9/9/19, 11:50 AM - Shona 😍: I'm in a very bad mood
9/9/19, 11:51 AM - Shona 😍: Waited outside in the line in 12°C for 3h in the morning
9/9/19, 11:51 AM - Shona 😍: Did not get the ticket
9/9/19, 11:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What the fuck?
9/9/19, 12:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But why?
9/9/19, 12:04 PM - Shona 😍: They ran out of them
9/9/19, 12:04 PM - Shona 😍: In total I waited 3.5h...
9/9/19, 12:04 PM - Shona 😍: But some people had waited all night...
9/9/19, 12:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How many were there? And by how much did you miss em?
9/9/19, 12:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Any other way to get the tickets?
9/9/19, 12:26 PM - Shona 😍: I dunno
9/9/19, 12:26 PM - Shona 😍: Some hundreds I guess
9/9/19, 12:26 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe 200
9/9/19, 12:27 PM - Shona 😍: I missed them by 20 or something
9/9/19, 12:27 PM - Shona 😍: Half an hour earlier would've been enough I guess
9/9/19, 12:27 PM - Shona 😍: Worst part was probably missing an interesting lecture because of this...
9/9/19, 12:27 PM - Shona 😍: Oh well
9/9/19, 12:28 PM - Shona 😍: It was a decision
9/9/19, 12:28 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe a bad one
9/9/19, 12:28 PM - Shona 😍: But I stand by it
9/9/19, 12:28 PM - Shona 😍: And I tried
9/9/19, 12:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel bad.
9/9/19, 12:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is there anything I can do?
9/9/19, 12:46 PM - Shona 😍: You can stop cutting calls like that
9/9/19, 12:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
9/9/19, 12:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I promise I will not do it ever
9/9/19, 12:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ever again
9/9/19, 12:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
9/9/19, 12:48 PM - Shona 😍: It was still the worst part of the night, and I pretty much deep froze during the wait for the tickets
9/9/19, 12:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm.
9/9/19, 12:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But baby. There is only limited amounts of patience in me. In the event of churning through most of the things throughout the day
9/9/19, 12:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was depleted yesterday
9/9/19, 12:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing was working and my head was hurting
9/9/19, 12:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And all the collective frustration of not being with you was not helping.
9/9/19, 12:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also, I found a cure to all your problems
9/9/19, 12:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Also it could be our anniversary gift
9/9/19, 12:56 PM - Shona 😍: Ok
9/9/19, 12:56 PM - Shona 😍: I'm in class
9/9/19, 12:56 PM - Shona 😍: Will get back to you
9/9/19, 2:06 PM - Shona 😍: Thank you
9/9/19, 2:06 PM - Shona 😍: What might that be?
9/9/19, 2:07 PM - Shona 😍: Wow the class is boring
9/9/19, 2:07 PM - Shona 😍: Super difficult to focus
9/9/19, 2:07 PM - Shona 😍: Maybe because I'm so tired
9/9/19, 2:07 PM - Shona 😍: And now I'm just thinking about sex 🙄
9/9/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's also biology
9/9/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you are not much distracted
9/9/19, 2:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I love you

9/9/19, 9:35 PM - Shona 😍: Just a sec
9/10/19, 12:59 AM - Shona 😍: In the equation of me sleeping with someone else and you not being allowed to do the same it doesn't sound like you value yourself very much
9/10/19, 12:59 AM - Shona 😍: My time and attention would be spent elsewhere
9/10/19, 1:12 AM - Shona 😍: But maybe I'm wrong
9/10/19, 1:41 AM - Shona 😍: About the ripped body? Makes me wanna lick that body all over, suck the hell out of that dick, feel those strong arms around me and pressing me against that body, makes me wanna sit on that face and have that body on me and fucking me for hours

9/10/19, 10:24 AM - Shona 😍: And you skipped the morning class again?
9/10/19, 10:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nono

9/10/19, 10:29 AM - Shona 😍: Okay
9/10/19, 10:29 AM - Shona 😍: But this
9/10/19, 10:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe
9/10/19, 10:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I think it's about the applications
9/10/19, 10:29 AM - Shona 😍: Do you know what you'll be doing today?

9/10/19, 10:50 AM - Shona 😍: I can make time
9/10/19, 10:51 AM - Shona 😍: The international exchange info is not that important, I can figure that stuff out on my own if needed
9/10/19, 10:51 AM - Shona 😍: If you want to talk
9/10/19, 10:51 AM - Shona 😍: We have not prioritized talking
9/10/19, 10:51 AM - Shona 😍: And we need to think about the future
9/10/19, 10:51 AM - Shona 😍: It's from 12-14
9/10/19, 10:51 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No. You should go
9/10/19, 10:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's important
9/10/19, 10:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Slip out then if you don't like it
9/10/19, 10:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But don't just miss out completely
9/10/19, 10:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to study too
9/10/19, 10:52 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Rejections are going to be there.
9/10/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Many more are to come
9/10/19, 10:53 AM - Shona 😍: I know
9/10/19, 10:54 AM - Shona 😍: Well can we do the planning at some point?
9/10/19, 10:54 AM - Shona 😍: So that I know your schedule
9/10/19, 10:54 AM - Shona 😍: And you should know mine
9/10/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
9/10/19, 10:54 AM - Shona 😍: So that we can also make time for talking
9/10/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That seems like a good idea
9/10/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
9/10/19, 10:55 AM - Shona 😍: When are you free today?
9/10/19, 10:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Rn 😅
9/10/19, 10:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And of course at night
9/10/19, 10:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to do self study
9/10/19, 10:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So it is pretty much upto me
9/10/19, 10:56 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me do this.
9/10/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have some tasks.
9/10/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me write them down
9/10/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then I will know
9/10/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have just been panicking since morning
9/10/19, 10:57 AM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/10/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I don't know what is the answer to this question
9/10/19, 10:57 AM - Shona 😍: And send them to me too
9/10/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.

9/10/19, 11:03 AM - Shona 😍: From 12 to 6
9/10/19, 11:03 AM - Shona 😍: Gotta get some things done in that time
9/10/19, 11:03 AM - Shona 😍: But plenty of time to talk/plan as well
9/10/19, 11:04 AM - Shona 😍: So if you can schedule in some talking/ planning during that time would be great
9/10/19, 11:04 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Ok
9/10/19, 11:10 AM - Shona 😍: Also, just crossed my mind, something you said yesterday. You said you almost feel embarrassed to tell me about thw astrologer and what they said. I don't want you to feel embarrassed about something like that. Maybe I've been an ass about it before and that's why you felt that way. I'm sorry if I have been. Even if I don't believe in such a thing I want you to be able to discuss it with me freely and without getting the feeling of being judged. Applies to other things as well.
9/10/19, 11:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hmm
9/10/19, 11:10 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You really are focusing on the class 😅
9/10/19, 11:13 AM - Shona 😍: The lecturer is super boring 🙄
9/10/19, 11:13 AM - Shona 😍: Topic is kinda interesting
9/10/19, 11:13 AM - Shona 😍: Medicine and ethics
9/10/19, 11:13 AM - Shona 😍: But it's not interesting like this
9/10/19, 11:14 AM - Shona 😍: Him just monotonously blabbering about it
9/10/19, 11:14 AM - Shona 😍: Gonna study anatomy or something
9/10/19, 11:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
9/10/19, 11:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Go do it then
9/10/19, 11:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will make the list and send it to you in 5 mins.
9/10/19, 11:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: <Media omitted>

9/10/19, 1:20 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: so badly that I have to make something happen for me
9/10/19, 1:20 PM - Shona 😍: So maybe that should be the next step

9/12/19, 11:21 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I haven't written to you in a while. Such has been the distance between us that it has been hard. It's like the roles have reversed. You are getting high all the time and I am super busy. You are getting on with a somewhat chillaxed schedule in which you have all the time for your emotions and I on the other hand don't even have the time to cry. But still there are somethings that I want you to know explicitly. I love you and I love you very much. And I am super proud of you. It is quite unbelievable that my silly Hanna is going to be a doctor. And I am engineer. I am proud of you because not only you are keeping your shit together but you are also being there for me. Oh my God! Now that I am typing this right now, I am realizing that I am finally, having this with someone, what I always wanted! There is finally someone in my life who is there for me in a constructive way and I am also attached to them. You are not just a presence in my life Shona! You support it. Like a pillar. You hold me together. You remember in our time in Gurgaon we realized that I don't share much? But look at what we have achieved now. We both achieve together now and we both engage each other emotionally. We are always there  for each other, through thick and thin. I am almost crying, realizing now that you are so crucial to me. You are amazing darling! Amazing! I love you. Tell me all about the party! I want to know. I love you. Good night take care. I am proud of you and I love you.

9/13/19, 2:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I think that also puts an end to the question of what kind of a wedding do you guys want to have
9/13/19, 2:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *we
9/13/19, 2:57 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry
9/13/19, 2:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Am I concluding too fast?
9/13/19, 3:09 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah you are
9/13/19, 3:09 PM - Shona 😍: But
9/13/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: What I care about is getting to be with you
9/13/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: And being married to you
9/13/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: Not the wedding
9/13/19, 3:11 PM - Shona 😍: Like how that's gonna happen
9/13/19, 3:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What do you mean
9/13/19, 3:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not sure I understand
9/13/19, 3:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This I do.
9/13/19, 3:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
9/13/19, 3:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Does that mean that you don't mind if we do an Indian wedding, a Christian wedding or a refugee wedding?
9/13/19, 3:13 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what I'm saying
9/13/19, 3:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hihi
9/13/19, 3:13 PM - Shona 😍: First I thought the wedding is not that important
9/13/19, 3:14 PM - Shona 😍: Like the ceremony etc
9/13/19, 3:14 PM - Shona 😍: But now that I think of it, it would be nice to make it... Well put effort into it too
9/13/19, 3:14 PM - Shona 😍: Though what kinda effort
9/13/19, 3:15 PM - Shona 😍: That seems like a lovely thing to do what they did
9/13/19, 3:15 PM - Shona 😍: But then there is also our families and all the relatives
9/13/19, 3:16 PM - Shona 😍: Hehe

9/13/19, 3:17 PM - Shona 😍: What do you mean
9/13/19, 3:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But there will come a time to discuss all that
9/13/19, 3:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean the random flow of thoughts dragging you with itself
9/13/19, 3:17 PM - Shona 😍: Ah

9/13/19, 3:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See.
9/13/19, 3:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not about toning it down overall
9/13/19, 3:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's about toning down the unnecessary bit down

9/13/19, 11:32 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry
9/13/19, 11:32 PM - Shona 😍: I can't
9/13/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Talk to me?
9/13/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it something that I said?
9/13/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sure there must be a misunderstanding
9/13/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please
9/13/19, 11:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Talk to me
9/13/19, 11:36 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah it is something you said
9/13/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So you want a hot body and if I say the same it is bad?
9/13/19, 11:37 PM - Shona 😍: I never asked you to do it for me
9/13/19, 11:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So?
9/13/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You still like it
9/13/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I know you will prefer one
9/13/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I said the same
9/13/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I said let's do it together
9/13/19, 11:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It is the journey I am more interested in
9/13/19, 11:39 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let alone for me, the whole idea of me proposing it was because I think you like to gain muscle as well
9/13/19, 11:39 PM - Shona 😍: Somehow this approach seems very twisted to me
9/13/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What approach Shona baccha. I am not saying I don't like you. I am not saying I will like you more if you were to have that body. All I'm saying is that
1) I just realized I liked that kind a body.
2) I really like what the YouTuber does 
3) it is challenging to build that kind of a body
4) the journey is tiring
5) I am going to do it
6) I know you like it
7 )  let's do it together
 The 1st point can be taken as an end. Because if you see , the whole idea of the proposal has multiple logics. It is just that I realized that like you I prefer lean built up bodies as well because in the past I have told you and I have always liked chubby bodies more. In the recent times, fitness videos have really inspired me to do more challenging stuff and become fit. I know those things are the same with you and I thought this is a path we can tread together
9/13/19, 11:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am also thinking of considering clinical psychology as a majors so that I can practice with you. Because I want to do something with you. Because I really liked our time spent here.
9/13/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: I'm insanely pissed atm
9/13/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: I can't think rationally
9/13/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Another  reason why I do gym is because I feel it makes me feel I am doing something that she likes and that makes me feel closer to you.
9/13/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: I'm gonna have to calm down first
9/13/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can call and curse?
9/13/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Say it in Finnish
9/13/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: Not gonna help
9/13/19, 11:45 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think it will be fine
9/13/19, 11:45 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know what to do
9/13/19, 11:46 PM - Shona 😍: I don't want to say stuff I'll regret
9/13/19, 11:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can understand. I must be at fault.  This is a sensitive topic to you.
9/13/19, 11:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You don't have to. I will not take your words literally?
9/13/19, 11:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But letting your emotions is also necessary
9/13/19, 11:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please?
9/13/19, 11:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry. I will not call again.
9/13/19, 11:48 PM - Shona 😍: I felt like breaking up with you right there
9/13/19, 11:48 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That's ok. Sometimes it feels like that
9/13/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But please don't think it rationally then
9/13/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Call me and talk to me
9/13/19, 11:49 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Tell me how you feel
9/13/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: Like you just change your mind on what you like
9/13/19, 11:49 PM - Shona 😍: And like I'm just some kind of product you can change according to your preferences
9/13/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I prefer a lot of things
9/13/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Why didn't I say them to you?
9/13/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Do I always come up with such requestd?
9/13/19, 11:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *requests
9/13/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/13/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did I ask you to put on weight because I like chubby girls?
9/13/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: When have I done that?
9/13/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: If yes, I would like to change that habit
9/13/19, 11:51 PM - Shona 😍: Seriously let's not
9/13/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't realize I do that
9/13/19, 11:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I try not to
9/13/19, 11:52 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know
9/13/19, 11:52 PM - Shona 😍: What the fuck
9/13/19, 11:52 PM - Shona 😍: I don't care
9/13/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Arrey tell me
9/13/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I seriously try not to do it
9/13/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I know that I have done it in the past relationships
9/13/19, 11:52 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought it has gone
9/13/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
9/13/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I request you
9/13/19, 11:53 PM - Shona 😍: I'm seriously disgusted
9/13/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am trying to improve here.
9/13/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So am I. Not with you but with myself
9/13/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd if it is really bad
9/13/19, 11:53 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then you are free to do this.
9/13/19, 11:54 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not fit for you.
9/13/19, 11:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will let you decide. Good night. I never meant to let you down. I try each day to not hurt you. I am a malignant man. I understand that you are hurt and I would never want to hurt you. Or turn you into a preference. I am sorry if you felt that. You deserve better. Good night.
9/13/19, 11:55 PM - Shona 😍: I can't think straight atm
9/13/19, 11:56 PM - Shona 😍: So maybe better indeed to talk about it later
9/13/19, 11:56 PM - Shona 😍: After calming down
9/14/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good night
9/14/19, 1:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am anxious

9/14/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It harms me equally when I mistreat you
9/14/19, 1:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe I should be more careful with my words

9/16/19, 10:22 AM - Shona 😍: 😅😅
9/16/19, 10:22 AM - Shona 😍: Can't really talk here
9/16/19, 10:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You are late
9/16/19, 10:22 AM - Shona 😍: Like stuffed
9/16/19, 10:22 AM - Shona 😍: No
9/16/19, 10:22 AM - Shona 😍: Bus was late
9/16/19, 10:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh

9/16/19, 10:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: For your day
9/16/19, 10:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Were the heels delivered already?
9/16/19, 10:31 AM - Shona 😍: Thanks😚
9/16/19, 10:31 AM - Shona 😍: Nope
9/16/19, 10:31 AM - Shona 😍: Today or tomorrow
9/16/19, 10:31 AM - Shona 😍: Got the loan btw
9/16/19, 10:32 AM - Shona 😍: Hihi the bus is like in India
9/16/19, 10:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
9/16/19, 10:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Great!
9/16/19, 10:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I understand that you want to save
9/16/19, 10:35 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But you still need to buy a coat and a good one , get the heals and please start working out. The last one needs a lot of reading up and educating yourself and that is why you need to join the classes. Yes the whole thing will cost you 350-370 but. All these are essentials.
9/16/19, 10:36 AM - Shona 😍: True...
9/16/19, 10:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And please don't go cheap on things. You can clearly see what quality stuff does to your life. For eg the laptop, the phone, my sister was saying the same thing about her gadgets and saying that it seems like a waste of money in that instant but you only reap the benefits in the longer run
9/16/19, 10:38 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please whenever you can. Go to a mango store and buy a good coat for yourself. Or wherever you can find one.
9/16/19, 10:53 AM - Shona 😍: That's very true
9/16/19, 3:31 PM - Shona 😍: Turns out the tickets are available on the 18th in the morning
9/16/19, 3:32 PM - Shona 😍: So it's not tonight
9/16/19, 3:32 PM - Shona 😍: The wait 😬
9/16/19, 3:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yay!
9/16/19, 3:32 PM - Shona 😍: Yes... 😍😍
9/16/19, 3:32 PM - Shona 😍: How's it going for you?
9/16/19, 3:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Very tedious
9/16/19, 3:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Have been studying since morning 8 o clock
9/16/19, 3:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Cycle got punctured
9/16/19, 3:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Turns out had to get the tire replaced
9/16/19, 3:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Took a break

9/16/19, 4:17 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah

9/17/19, 12:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Should we speak to a sleep specialist?
9/17/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it because of the house?
9/17/19, 12:25 AM - Shona 😍: No
9/17/19, 12:25 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or the lack of my body heat?

9/17/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What the actual fuck
9/17/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it because of that
9/17/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That you feel pressured
9/17/19, 12:30 AM - Shona 😍: What
9/17/19, 12:30 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That a lot depends on tonight's sleep

9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 🤦🏻‍♂
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Somehow I never prepared myself for these situations in which I feel so clueless when it comes to consoling you
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I try but to no resolve
9/17/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: You can't do it all with the distance
9/17/19, 12:35 AM - Shona 😍: Just hugging you would be enough
9/17/19, 12:56 AM - Shona 😍: I'm trying to watch a Bollywood film
9/17/19, 12:57 AM - Shona 😍: But it's so overdramatic 😂

9/17/19, 7:18 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅
9/17/19, 7:18 PM - Shona 😍: 🤣
9/17/19, 8:31 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Take one teaspoon of turmeric and take it with hot water(for more effective use, dissolve honey in hot water) use it overnight and see if it works for you. Turmeric is anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial. So it should cure the cough. Mom claims it will cure you almost 50% but I am guessing even 25% will be a big jump. 
Now you may or may not believe in this and I will not be surprised if you totally overlook this, but this was told by my mother and she is very good with these naturopathic and ayurvedic cures so I am 80%  sure that it will work. I also googled and it seems like it might but then again, there is no harm in trying.
9/17/19, 8:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/JLKrZnic9uA
9/17/19, 8:56 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This video has everything.
9/17/19, 8:58 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I wrote down a framework to your problem. 
In a consultant style. So as to see what is the real issue and where it lies. But he went a step further ahead and used the framework to provide applicable solutions. Please watch the video when you are at peace with yourself and you will be good to go. I think you will find all your answers there.
9/17/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah! But I don't have turmeric here with me😅 gonna to wait till tomorrow
9/17/19, 9:11 PM - Shona 😍: Uuuuuh!!!
9/17/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: https://youtu.be/Q66OMce-vl8
9/17/19, 9:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: This is another excellent tips and tricks video for productivity and time management. Please please please see it
9/17/19, 9:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She makes a lot of sense.
9/17/19, 9:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I would suggest going through both the videos and combining their knowledge. What you can also do is, make a productivity system of your own and take notes of all the rules and habits these people are mentioning. I think it will help a lot. An awful lot.
9/17/19, 9:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can do it together if you want
9/17/19, 9:15 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But preaching so much productivity to you tells me that I would want to do something like this myself. Let's see after exam how much I can do and what all I can do
9/17/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: ❤
9/17/19, 11:57 PM - Shona 😍: It's so much fun here 😍😍

9/18/19, 3:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *low
9/18/19, 3:27 PM - Shona 😍: Awesome baby 💕🤗
9/18/19, 3:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: One more left and then 🔥🔥🔥
9/18/19, 3:28 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I talked to Laura for two hours yesterday
9/18/19, 3:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was amazing
9/18/19, 3:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did you sleep
9/18/19, 3:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I said something to her which I think makes sense
9/18/19, 3:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I think is quite applicable to you as well
9/18/19, 3:30 PM - Shona 😍: And that would be
9/18/19, 3:30 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I realized that in villages in India, people are very slow, the transportation is slow, people have to grow far off distance and that takes time, no 3g or 4g, basically no internet. Sometimes not even electricity, not even proper tools. As a result things take time, they are much slower, much much slower, average day looks like 7 hours of slow work and meals and family time and early to bed and early to rise. 
But I noted one peculiar thing, they are very happy and satisfied and with their lives.
Now my question to us-you and me- is, that if our end goal in life is also happiness, satiation and fulfillment then have we in the cities progressed too much for our own good? Too much rushing into things, get so many things done and still feel that never enough? Do we really lack time or is it a mirage? 
I don't know the answer. But am looking, but I think it's a relevant question for you as well. 
I am guessing the answer will be found with solace in isolation and bliss. 
Probably by the river and hence the suggestion. 
Leave your phone behind. Take yourself with you. And just be idle. It's really difficult but, I think, the answers lie on the other side.
9/18/19, 3:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Btw
9/18/19, 3:37 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: How did you sleep?

9/18/19, 6:43 PM - Shona 😍: Depending on what you want to focus on in life
9/18/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Wow!
9/18/19, 6:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The quality of education!
9/18/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah
9/18/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: I love it
9/18/19, 6:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What do you think about that?
9/18/19, 6:50 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know
9/18/19, 6:50 PM - Shona 😍: Sounds really soon
9/18/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah it does
9/18/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But still
9/18/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is kinda scary
9/18/19, 6:50 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean why the heck would you say that?
9/18/19, 6:51 PM - Shona 😍: Well maybe it's the reality
9/18/19, 6:52 PM - Shona 😍: You just have more time and freedom at this time
9/18/19, 6:52 PM - Shona 😍: They told how their kids had to stay in daycare for very long days
9/18/19, 6:53 PM - Shona 😍: Also lot of them had doctors as spouses
9/18/19, 6:53 PM - Shona 😍: So that maybe affects it as well
9/18/19, 6:53 PM - Shona 😍: I would want to spend a lot of time with my kids when I have them
9/18/19, 6:54 PM - Shona 😍: And not just put them in daycare
9/18/19, 7:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Too bad your man is an engineer
9/18/19, 7:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😅😅
9/18/19, 7:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He will have all the time in the world

9/18/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: I would love to work from home or something
9/18/19, 7:04 PM - Shona 😍: When the kids are young
9/18/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: Or do shorter days
9/18/19, 7:07 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know how that would be possible as a doctor
9/18/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: And I do think the slowness and lot of family time would be related to the happiness
9/18/19, 7:08 PM - Shona 😍: But these people in the villages have different struggles
9/18/19, 7:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Everyone has those but not of the kind in which you are partying too much and also feel a lack of time

9/21/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The usual culprit
9/21/19, 11:45 AM - Shona 😍: Hmm
9/21/19, 11:45 AM - Shona 😍: Throw your phone out of the window?
9/21/19, 11:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hehe. I wish.
9/21/19, 11:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then at the end of the day I have to talk to you
9/21/19, 11:46 AM - Shona 😍: True 🤔
9/21/19, 11:46 AM - Shona 😍: Well then you can go get it
9/21/19, 11:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Hehe
9/21/19, 11:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or
9/21/19, 11:49 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can do a session together
9/21/19, 11:54 AM - Shona 😍: Yeah
9/21/19, 11:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now?
9/21/19, 11:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or later?
9/21/19, 12:08 PM - Shona 😍: We can start now
9/21/19, 12:08 PM - Shona 😍: Or did you already?
9/21/19, 12:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah. I have to go to Lucknow
9/21/19, 12:14 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maasi called 😅
9/21/19, 12:14 PM - Shona 😍: ???
9/21/19, 12:14 PM - Shona 😍: Why do you need to go?
9/21/19, 12:17 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Her phone needs to be repaired
9/21/19, 12:54 PM - Shona 😍: Okay one thing I've been wondering about is all the new people. Like who to hang out with. How much to hang out with the ones I already know to some extent and deepen those relationships, like at such parties, and how much to talk to new people and see if we hit it off. Like yesterday, I realized I hadn't hung out with Mikko much after the toga party, and we really had good time back then. So I texted him if he was going to see the games and the afterparty. He hadn't planned to come but now he did. So a lot of the time at the afterparty I hung out with him, which was nice and again I got to know him a bit better. Okay so I'm happy about that. Then there's this girl, Juliette, whom I've got to know better as well, we're going on the cruises together, with some other girls as well. She's super nice and we hang out at the uni and at these events.
9/21/19, 12:55 PM - Shona 😍: Okay I guess the question will answer itself, I don't need to be thinking about it that much.
9/21/19, 12:57 PM - Shona 😍: This is kind of a new situation and I'm not even sure what kind of people am I looking for. Mostly because I don't know myself that well yet. I have a much better idea than a year ago, for example, but it's gonna take time and trying a lot of new things.
9/21/19, 12:57 PM - Shona 😍: oh and btw
9/21/19, 12:58 PM - Shona 😍: The cruise for which we waited for the tickets overnight?
9/21/19, 12:58 PM - Shona 😍: Now some people are saying it's all about partying and no lectures
9/21/19, 12:59 PM - Shona 😍: That they show us some porn or something
9/21/19, 12:59 PM - Shona 😍: But them saying that might also be pranking
9/21/19, 1:00 PM - Shona 😍: so we have no clue what to believe 😅😂
9/21/19, 1:00 PM - Shona 😍: Just gonna have to wait and see
9/21/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: And seriously this energy drink
9/21/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: I'm already addicted
9/21/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: It's so good
9/21/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: Just caffeine, some amino acids and vitamins, and sweeteners, no sugar at all...
9/21/19, 1:01 PM - Shona 😍: It tastes so nice
9/21/19, 1:02 PM - Shona 😍: And makes me feel very awake in the morning when I haven't eaten yet
9/21/19, 1:02 PM - Shona 😍: I've been doing 14h fasts
9/21/19, 1:09 PM - Shona 😍: If it counts with the energy drinks, they do have like 12kcal but that's only from the free branched chain amino acids, which are easily absorbed
9/21/19, 1:09 PM - Shona 😍: Juliette said she used to be addicted to this drink 😅
9/21/19, 1:09 PM - Shona 😍: But I think I can keep it in moderation if I have only one per day
9/21/19, 1:15 PM - Shona 😍: Then there was also talk about these sponsored events
9/21/19, 1:17 PM - Shona 😍: The pharmaceutical companies and private health care providers sponsoring our foods etc
9/21/19, 1:17 PM - Shona 😍: Like is that ethical
9/21/19, 1:17 PM - Shona 😍: Apparently they used to pay for the med students' ski trips or something!
9/21/19, 1:18 PM - Shona 😍: But then the legislation changed
9/21/19, 1:19 PM - Shona 😍: Now they're not technically allowed to market things to students before the 4th year (the year after which we can work as doctors)
9/21/19, 1:20 PM - Shona 😍: But apparently these sponsored meals still happen
9/21/19, 1:27 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
9/21/19, 1:30 PM - Shona 😍: I wish I could ride the scooty to Lucknow with you!!
9/21/19, 1:30 PM - Shona 😍: Or from here to Vantaa
9/21/19, 2:02 PM - Shona 😍: Also please drive safe Shona

9/21/19, 2:19 PM - Shona 😍: the feel of your skin against mine
9/21/19, 2:20 PM - Shona 😍: lying next to you naked, our bodies tangled

9/21/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I remember stepping on Nelli's foot once
9/21/19, 3:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: She was very mannered though

9/22/19, 4:10 PM - Shona 😍: so it's not just about you
9/22/19, 4:10 PM - Shona 😍: no I'm not tracking with an app
9/22/19, 4:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: True
9/22/19, 4:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Well that is what I am more embarrassed about
9/22/19, 4:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Promising it to you
9/22/19, 4:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I fail myself all the time
9/22/19, 4:10 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand
9/22/19, 4:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What I like in my relationship is that I  very seldom  fail you
9/22/19, 4:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But that happened yesterday
9/22/19, 4:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I need to think
9/22/19, 4:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was enough that I was worried
9/22/19, 4:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then I sought your help
9/22/19, 4:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd in the event of seeking your help
9/22/19, 4:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I worried you
9/22/19, 4:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And now I also broke a promise
9/22/19, 4:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That word means nothing to me in general
9/22/19, 4:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: People do it all the time
9/22/19, 4:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: They break their promises all the time
9/22/19, 4:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I try keep my promises to you and maa
9/22/19, 4:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is why I want it to be that way
9/22/19, 4:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I am really disgusted
9/22/19, 4:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With myself
9/22/19, 4:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I didn't keep my word
9/22/19, 4:21 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 4:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Generally I have kept my promises in the past.
9/22/19, 4:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yesterday when I promised
9/22/19, 4:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I thought that will be my motivation to work
9/22/19, 4:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But then everyone was in a very unique mood yesterday
9/22/19, 4:27 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I just didn't know whether it was wise to work
9/22/19, 5:32 PM - Shona 😍: Are you not gonna work at all today?
9/22/19, 5:33 PM - Shona 😍: Yesterday when you said you promise to do it, I didn't first believe you
9/22/19, 5:34 PM - Shona 😍: Because with work you have done that before as well
9/22/19, 5:34 PM - Shona 😍: Aiming for something and then not being able to complete it
9/22/19, 5:35 PM - Shona 😍: but this is different, you said a clear, reasonable target but didn't do it
9/22/19, 5:35 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if I should've said something right away
9/22/19, 5:35 PM - Shona 😍: Because you tend to not work when hanging out with family
9/22/19, 5:36 PM - Shona 😍: though I thought it's different with Maasi, that you can work
9/22/19, 5:36 PM - Shona 😍: when you're around her
9/22/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can understand why you believed me
9/22/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I respect the fact that you did.
9/22/19, 5:40 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am really very sorry to disappoint you
9/22/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I need a break for a week I guess. I need to figure my shit out
9/22/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am too much in chaos
9/22/19, 5:41 PM - Shona 😍: excuse me??
9/22/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is somehow disturbing you
9/22/19, 5:41 PM - Shona 😍: This was supposed to be the intense studying week??
9/22/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nd I don't like it
9/22/19, 5:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes. It will be.
9/22/19, 5:41 PM - Shona 😍: oh
9/22/19, 5:42 PM - Shona 😍: you meant break from us?
9/22/19, 5:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah.
9/22/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know what to do
9/22/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Everything is too much
9/22/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The studies
9/22/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The exams
9/22/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The relationship
9/22/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My other relationships
9/22/19, 5:43 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I feel burned out
9/22/19, 5:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't when was the last time I actually stopped and thought for a minute about myself
9/22/19, 5:44 PM - Shona 😍: Very well then
9/22/19, 5:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Seriously? That is how you are going to roll?
9/22/19, 5:44 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Anger?
9/22/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not angry
9/22/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: Or wasn't
9/22/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: But you were angry yourself last spring when I asked for the samw
9/22/19, 5:45 PM - Shona 😍: So no need to lecture me on how to feel
9/22/19, 5:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So is this just a replay of feelings?
9/22/19, 5:46 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Just cause I was unreasonable you get to have some kind of leverage?
9/22/19, 5:46 PM - Shona 😍: Can we talk on call
9/22/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: Just feels like misunderstandings
9/22/19, 5:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe later
9/22/19, 5:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not in the state rn
9/22/19, 5:47 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am at home and I am in a very bad mood
9/22/19, 5:47 PM - Shona 😍: 👍🏼
9/22/19, 6:00 PM - Shona 😍: And when you've calmed down could please take a look at what you're saying and see who's talking
9/22/19, 6:00 PM - Shona 😍: You're the one being unreasonable now
9/22/19, 6:05 PM - Shona 😍: I know you're under a lot of pressure these days and I would've wanted to give you that break if that's what you really want
9/22/19, 6:31 PM - Shona 😍: Also I've been thinking that maybe I shouldn't have stayed for so long
9/22/19, 6:31 PM - Shona 😍: In India
9/22/19, 6:31 PM - Shona 😍: You could've worked more
9/22/19, 6:31 PM - Shona 😍: I could've come to Kuopio earlier
9/22/19, 6:31 PM - Shona 😍: Or worked more
9/22/19, 6:32 PM - Shona 😍: I'm not saying I regret it
9/22/19, 6:32 PM - Shona 😍: No
9/22/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe
9/22/19, 6:32 PM - Shona 😍: But maybe that would've been smarter
9/22/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But if you really think about it
9/22/19, 6:32 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not really that worked up
9/22/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just so stressed
9/22/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That I am not doing any
9/22/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And just being dysfunctional
9/22/19, 6:33 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It was the same before exams and it was thereafter
9/22/19, 6:36 PM - Shona 😍: Do you want to actually plan with me again?
9/22/19, 6:36 PM - Shona 😍: Or do it how you like
9/22/19, 6:43 PM - Shona 😍: You need to have time for yourself as well
9/22/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: To take care of yourself
9/22/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: Like last night
9/22/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: You said we can talk
9/22/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: But you needed sleep
9/22/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: It was better that you slept
9/22/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: And you need time for relaxing as well
9/22/19, 6:44 PM - Shona 😍: Like yesterday with Maa and Maasi
9/22/19, 6:45 PM - Shona 😍: But then being realistic about it helps
9/22/19, 6:45 PM - Shona 😍: Knowing that you need all that too
9/22/19, 6:45 PM - Shona 😍: So when you do it, you don't need to feel guilty about it
9/22/19, 7:40 PM - Shona 😍: Shona?
9/22/19, 8:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes

9/23/19, 7:55 PM - Shona 😍: Exactly
9/23/19, 7:55 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I have to upskill myself

9/24/19, 10:34 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
9/24/19, 10:36 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You see my masturbating habits are no better than my porn habits. If not the same, they are based on the same principles and the behavior change around them needs to happen, I am addicted to it and to be honest by the end of this year, I want to get off of every addiction.

9/25/19, 12:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Even I don't know what it means

9/25/19, 12:38 PM - Shona 😍: But I remember that I was with someone, maybe you. There were people preparing a celebration, I think it was a wedding. We just randomly talked to some older woman like hey, what's going on here, and she told us what's happening. I just remember liking it very much, how we could talk to random people like that and start a conversation with anyone. As in Finland it often feels like people have the attitude of "mind your own business"

9/25/19, 7:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: two hours per day on social media and related messaging services, with close to half that time dedicated to Facebook’s products alone. Similarly, a first adopter who picked up an iPhone in 2007 for the music features would be less enthusiastic if told that within a decade he could expect to compulsively check the device eighty-five times a day—a “feature” we now know Steve Jobs never considered as he prepared his famous keynote.

9/26/19, 9:31 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning shona
9/26/19, 11:16 AM - Shona 😍: What's your plan for the day?
9/26/19, 11:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Finish 10 topics of PARIKSHA. Finish one chapter of Khan. That's it. I don't think I can do more. I have gym and classes
9/26/19, 11:18 AM - Shona 😍: Accha
9/26/19, 11:19 AM - Shona 😍: You've started already, right?
9/26/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah.
9/26/19, 11:24 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Pariksha half done
9/26/19, 11:27 AM - Shona 😍: Amazing 👏🏼
9/26/19, 12:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Did you return the heals and the coat?
9/26/19, 12:23 PM - Shona 😍: Sorry baby
9/26/19, 12:23 PM - Shona 😍: Not yet
9/26/19, 12:23 PM - Shona 😍: I'll do it by Sunday
9/26/19, 12:23 PM - Shona 😍: Not gonna take them to the new apartment 😬
9/26/19, 12:29 PM - Shona 😍: Or maybe I can do it today
9/26/19, 12:30 PM - Shona 😍: Not sure how long the post office is open
9/26/19, 12:30 PM - Shona 😍: Okay maybe not, I have the anatomy quiz tomorrow
9/26/19, 12:30 PM - Shona 😍: In the morning
9/26/19, 12:38 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Oh ok
9/26/19, 1:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The quiz is a small one. And you have already studied for it. The whole going to the post office will take 1 hour. It will only be wise to do it today only. Because, you are giving anatomy more time than required. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law
Parkinson's law - Wikipedia
9/26/19, 1:00 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Parkinson's law states that work fills up the time assigned to it.
9/26/19, 1:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So if you give the quiz 2 hours of studying it will be done in that. If 8 then that
9/26/19, 1:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: F-secure replied
9/26/19, 1:51 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't make it

9/26/19, 2:11 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah. I guess that's sums it up
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Shona 😍: Well. Now we know for sure what's not gonna happen.
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Exactly
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am not sad.
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am just more sure.
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Shona 😍: Me neither
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am seriously considering being a freelancer now
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What's the point in joining these corporates
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Shona 😍: Freelancer with what?
9/26/19, 3:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Is it really about the money?
9/26/19, 3:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Digital marketing and storytelling I guess.
9/26/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: I mean doing what
9/26/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: Ahh
9/26/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: Hmmm
9/26/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: You could do that right after graduation?
9/26/19, 3:10 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But seriously, I will have plenty time after I graduate and I am thinking about it
9/26/19, 3:10 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/26/19, 3:11 PM - Shona 😍: Baby
9/26/19, 3:11 PM - Shona 😍: I also wanted to ask your opinion
9/26/19, 3:11 PM - Shona 😍: I don't know if I should go to the Christian med students' meeting tonight
9/26/19, 3:12 PM - Shona 😍: I fear that I will feel out of place
9/26/19, 3:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You should!
9/26/19, 3:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No!
9/26/19, 3:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I will tell you something
9/26/19, 3:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It may be two kinds. 
1. A devotional meeting of doctors saying science is never going to beat god 
Or 
2.  A meeting of sensible heads trying to find balance between two in a rational logical awesome way. ❤
I have met some of the other kind in my college and it was a delight.
Please go
9/26/19, 3:15 PM - Shona 😍: Okay

9/26/19, 3:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am in a very good space with you rn
9/26/19, 3:29 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I hope it remains this way
9/26/19, 4:02 PM - Shona 😍: Yes :)
9/26/19, 4:02 PM - Shona 😍: It's partially conscious effort, at least for me
9/26/19, 4:02 PM - Shona 😍: But seems to become easier and easier
9/26/19, 4:03 PM - Shona 😍: To try to stay there
9/26/19, 4:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
9/26/19, 4:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Of course it is
9/26/19, 4:12 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And the conscious effort starts slipping away the more I think about how would it be if I were to be with you in person
9/26/19, 6:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Done with Pariskha for the day
9/26/19, 6:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Was super fast
9/26/19, 6:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am doing great with Pariskha these days.

9/26/19, 8:01 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
9/26/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I asked someone to check my form today
9/26/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Squats is good
9/26/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But they said terrible things about my presses and my deadlifts
9/26/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was very demotivated
9/26/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: What did they say?
9/26/19, 8:02 PM - Shona 😍: Yikes
9/26/19, 8:02 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I some how did half of my sets and came back
9/26/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: What was wrong in their opinion
9/26/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: Wha
9/26/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I did do 2 100kg squats today
9/26/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Correct posture
9/26/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: Whaaaaaaat. 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
9/26/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: That's insane
9/26/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: How cooooool
9/26/19, 8:03 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The presses were susceptible to shoulder dislocation
9/26/19, 8:03 PM - Shona 😍: 🤩🤩🤩
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: 😱
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And then the deadlifts were completely wrong
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But he gave me very very good advice
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He said don't lift more
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: ????
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: Why
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Lift many times
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: He said you don't have to increase the weight
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: You can increase the reps
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Shona 😍: Sure
9/26/19, 8:04 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that opinion I really liked
9/26/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: Depends on your goal
9/26/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Better to do it with correct posture
9/26/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: My goal is to be active
9/26/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Not dislocate my shoulder
9/26/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: And that's good
9/26/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: Yes
9/26/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: At least not again
9/26/19, 8:05 PM - Shona 😍: And if you like it better with more reps and less weight, I say go for it
9/26/19, 8:05 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think that is something I am most terrified of
9/26/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes.
9/26/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But
9/26/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: I can understand
9/26/19, 8:06 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 💯💯💯
This would not have been possible without you. I would have never dreamt of this.
9/26/19, 8:06 PM - Shona 😍: Seriously that's amazing...
9/26/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I can tell you. More than the pain. I think it was the fear of lifting that much.
9/26/19, 8:07 PM - Shona 😍: Aah
9/26/19, 8:07 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was more afraid than tired
9/26/19, 8:08 PM - Shona 😍: I understand
9/26/19, 8:08 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Are you ok?
9/26/19, 8:09 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah

9/26/19, 8:09 PM - Shona 😍: But that's just super cool
9/26/19, 8:09 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nothing imperative or declarative to say?
9/26/19, 8:09 PM - Shona 😍: I was wondering how did you do it
9/26/19, 8:09 PM - Shona 😍: Like was someone there to spot you
9/26/19, 8:09 PM - Shona 😍: Or did you just do it on your own
9/26/19, 8:10 PM - Shona 😍: And also that's really sexy...
9/26/19, 8:10 PM - Shona 😍: 😆
9/26/19, 8:11 PM - Shona 😍: And did you do them consecutively or with a break
9/26/19, 8:13 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Consecutive

9/27/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: I didn't remember
9/27/19, 1:35 AM - Shona 😍: We had the meeting earlier with my class
9/27/19, 1:36 AM - Shona 😍: It's a tradition to throw a party were we kind of revenge all the things our tutors put us through :D all the pranks etc
9/27/19, 1:36 AM - Shona 😍: So the meeting was about starting to plan that revenge party
9/27/19, 1:36 AM - Shona 😍: The theme and different teams for the organizing
9/27/19, 1:36 AM - Shona 😍: Also
9/27/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: I enrolled in a weekend training in October
9/27/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: It's about sex education for secondary school students
9/27/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: They teach us
9/27/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: And then we can go teach the students
9/27/19, 1:37 AM - Shona 😍: Mikko enrolled too
9/27/19, 1:38 AM - Shona 😍: The training and teaching is also a way to earn these points for exchange
9/27/19, 1:38 AM - Shona 😍: The more active you are, the likelier you get to a place that you prefer most
9/27/19, 1:39 AM - Shona 😍: Also the topic was way too interesting

9/27/19, 1:39 AM - Shona 😍: It's on 12th and 13th of October
9/27/19, 8:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
9/27/19, 9:37 AM - Shona 😍: Good morning kulta
9/27/19, 10:23 AM - Shona 😍: And baby
9/27/19, 10:23 AM - Shona 😍: I'm so lucky to have you in my life
9/27/19, 10:29 AM - Shona 😍: I love talking to you first thing in the morning, even if it's just saying good morning, and the last thing in the evening
9/27/19, 10:30 AM - Shona 😍: I'm waiting for the day when I can wake up next to you again, and fall asleep in your arms
9/27/19, 10:34 AM - Shona 😍: I wish you a lovely day. Keep working hard. You have been doing it for the past week and I'm amazed and very proud of you. I hope you don't overwork yourself either, and don't beat yourself up if you take a nap in the middle of the day. Those naps are refreshing. And afterwards it's good to start working again. I'm so happy, that there's only two more months left for you, October and November, and then you'll be done with the degree and placement prep!! Just two short months! The last month has passed by very fast, and I'm sure these two will too. I love you.
9/27/19, 10:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Babyyyy. It was amazing to read this message! But I want to share something with you. There is something extremely mesmerizing about this whole writing the long message and texting thing. It gives me a sense of direction. In the sense that it reminds me of who I am and what is my purpose in life. It feels it is only to somehow make a living for us. And I am very very proud baby of our bond. Yes, given the modern age and given its variety and opportunity, it is possible that we meet every month and be with each other physically after sacrificing so many things but also, what we seldom appreciate is how sweet these messages are, these messages are somewhat like love letters, written in the 80's or maybe even further in the past. It outlines to me the deepness of our bond as to  how much we are willing to hold on to each other for the sake of the peace we derive from our bond. I love you my darling. Yes the last month has passed crazy fast but again, it is nothing like how fast the time passed when you were here. For me the days seemed to just vanish then. But hey! I want to tell you that I was able to sleep very well. I slept until 8:53 then woke up. Went to the class late and then now I am done with the class and have another in 15 mins. I miss you darling. I miss you next to me too.
9/27/19, 10:45 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yeah! Keeps my head straight too!
9/27/19, 10:46 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: All the best for the quiz Shona

9/27/19, 4:41 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Now I am thinking if I should file a police report
9/27/19, 4:41 PM - Shona 😍: How does that work there?
9/27/19, 4:42 PM - Shona 😍: Is it easy or lot of bureaucracy?
9/27/19, 4:42 PM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't know. But I seriously don't feel like letting this one go
9/27/19, 4:42 PM - Shona 😍: Yeah!
9/27/19, 4:43 PM - Shona 😍: He should face some sanctions
9/27/19, 4:43 PM - Shona 😍: That's bullshit
9/27/19, 4:43 PM - Shona 😍: What he did

9/27/19, 6:58 PM - Shona 😍: Sure!!
9/27/19, 6:59 PM - Shona 😍: Just a sec
9/27/19, 9:38 PM - Shona 😍: <Media omitted>

9/28/19, 9:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Good morning baby
9/28/19, 9:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sorry beba
9/28/19, 9:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I had zen mode on while studying last night
9/28/19, 9:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: The timer had 45 mins left
9/28/19, 9:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I felt super super sleepy
9/28/19, 9:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So
9/28/19, 9:00 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I slept
9/28/19, 9:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: In the night I woke up and remembered that I didn't wish you good night
9/28/19, 9:01 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So I did this
9/28/19, 9:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry Shona. But I was very very very sleepy yesterday. I slept for 11 hours
9/28/19, 9:16 AM - Shona 😍: Could've used your laptop
9/28/19, 9:16 AM - Shona 😍: You stood me up
9/28/19, 9:16 AM - Shona 😍: And I worried
9/28/19, 9:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Didn't occur to me
9/28/19, 9:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was very very sleepy.
9/28/19, 9:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I was worried about that
9/28/19, 9:16 AM - Shona 😍: But glad that one of us could sleep
9/28/19, 9:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But in my mind it was just too clouded with sleep
9/28/19, 9:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I kept thinking about messaging you in the first half of my sleep
9/28/19, 9:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I felt very bad after reading this
9/28/19, 9:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry shona. Is there anyway I can make it upto you?
9/28/19, 9:26 AM - Shona 😍: I kept waiting for you to message or call
9/28/19, 9:26 AM - Shona 😍: You said we could talk
9/28/19, 9:26 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yes I did
9/28/19, 9:26 AM - Shona 😍: And I worried so that I had difficulty sleeping myself
9/28/19, 9:27 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Baby
9/28/19, 9:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I learned the lesson of not doing this
9/28/19, 9:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I really had no control over myself yesterday
9/28/19, 9:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I never sleep at 9
9/28/19, 9:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Never
9/28/19, 9:28 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am really very sorry
9/28/19, 9:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I didn't mean to do it
9/28/19, 9:29 AM - Shona 😍: Well it's not the first time
9/28/19, 9:29 AM - Shona 😍: You kept doing that in the summer
9/28/19, 9:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And how long ago was it the last time?
9/28/19, 9:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I know baby
9/28/19, 9:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have changed
9/28/19, 9:29 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But yesterday was a one off day
9/28/19, 9:36 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Haven't I?
9/28/19, 9:54 AM - Shona 😍: I think so
9/28/19, 9:55 AM - Shona 😍: But we haven't talked properly in ages
9/28/19, 9:55 AM - Shona 😍: Now that in particular is partially my fault too
9/28/19, 9:57 AM - Shona 😍: But we can't just leave it all for the future
9/28/19, 9:57 AM - Shona 😍: Because why would it be any different then
9/28/19, 10:11 AM - Shona 😍: if we can't schedule a proper talk daily, and I think that's the case, can we try doing it weekly?
9/28/19, 10:12 AM - Shona 😍: like we would have a date
9/28/19, 10:13 AM - Shona 😍: https://www.gottman.com/blog/if-youre-too-busy-for-date-night-youre-too-busy/
9/28/19, 10:13 AM - Shona 😍: this is a blog I really like
9/28/19, 10:14 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Shona. I think we are losing track here.
9/28/19, 10:14 AM - Shona 😍: of what
9/28/19, 10:15 AM - Shona 😍: ?
9/28/19, 10:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We are not able to talk these days because I devoted my entire time from my placement preparation to us when you were here. And so when the tests are going to start by 5th October I only have one week left to prepare everything.
9/28/19, 10:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's not like I don't have time for you
9/28/19, 10:15 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's just that these two weeks are going to be tough and that's what I told you
9/28/19, 10:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I talked to you in the exams and even before that
9/28/19, 10:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think very regularly
9/28/19, 10:16 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: It's just that these two weeks have a time crunch
9/28/19, 10:17 AM - Shona 😍: why don't we take the break then
9/28/19, 10:17 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And yeah, when other people have some emergency like a broken phone or a visit to the campus after several months, I am sidelining my relationship because, I don't want my life only to be about my relationship
9/28/19, 10:18 AM - Shona 😍: excuse me?
9/28/19, 10:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Nah
9/28/19, 10:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Please don't go in that direction
9/28/19, 10:18 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: What I mean is
9/28/19, 10:20 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: That yes, I can tell all those things-maasi and Abhishek- to fuck off and then just talk to you by devoting all my spare time to you. But that means jeopardizing my relationship with them on the expense of building one with you and I don't want that because I have done that in the past and that hasn't worked out very well
9/28/19, 10:21 AM - Shona 😍: I am by no means asking you to devote all your spare time to me
9/28/19, 10:21 AM - Shona 😍: no
9/28/19, 10:21 AM - Shona 😍: I am asking some of that time
9/28/19, 10:21 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because maybe I need you. When I work and workout I need you. Because your good mornings and good nights really calm my soul. Because your intentional keep it up baby and exclamations mesmerize me. Because seeing you once in a day elates me heart and because Making pout face for you even in public is silly and I love being silly with you.
9/28/19, 10:22 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I have been very reckless in doing that. Because baby, you have been busy as well. And, also, the situation is very stringent for about one more week. That's all that I am saying
9/28/19, 10:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But if you want that then we can do that.
9/28/19, 10:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I have to work all day today
9/28/19, 10:23 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Let me know if you want to do it together
9/28/19, 10:26 AM - Shona 😍: It was not smart to do that. To ditch the preparation back then. Like it wasn't smart for me not to do much anything when I was there. But okay, let's deal with the consequences now.
9/28/19, 10:29 AM - Shona 😍: It's not exactly easy for me. It feels like I'm here for you but you aren't there for me. And it's okay for a while, yes. Maybe I just shouldn't expect anything for the next two weeks then. And this is me rationalizing now.
9/28/19, 10:30 AM - Shona 😍: alright
9/28/19, 10:30 AM - Shona 😍: I can take that attitude
9/28/19, 10:30 AM - Shona 😍: it should be fine
9/28/19, 10:33 AM - Shona 😍: And you did say that earlier already
9/28/19, 10:33 AM - Shona 😍: that you're not gonna have the time
9/28/19, 10:33 AM - Shona 😍: okay
9/28/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or we can do one thing
9/28/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Sounds very shitty😞
9/28/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: 😖
9/28/19, 10:53 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: See
9/28/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can do one thing
9/28/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: We can limit our conversation on WhatsApp and then we can just talk on Duo daily
9/28/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I analsed
9/28/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: *tracked
9/28/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I spend an hour on average on WhatsApp
9/28/19, 10:54 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Maybe more than that
9/28/19, 10:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And we limit that
9/28/19, 10:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then we have one complete hour to talk in the night
9/28/19, 10:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And we both know from spring that you limiting your WhatsApp usage in the day helped you make more time to talk in the night
9/28/19, 10:55 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Or maybe we are looking at it the wrong way
9/28/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I don't need to remove as much as much as I need to be focused
9/28/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I think I am not able to do more than 6 hours of work anyway
9/28/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No matter what I do
9/28/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Class or no class
9/28/19, 10:57 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that's a lot anyways
9/28/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: So if that is what I need
9/28/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Then I can just do hours and stop worrying about the quantum of work
9/28/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I mean I only have finite amount of time
9/28/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And that is easily manageable
9/28/19, 10:58 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: With the zen mode
9/28/19, 11:03 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Because there are multiple problems occouring with this mentality
9/28/19, 11:06 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: No matter how much I get done I can never complete work. That never gives me the confidence that I have done enough
I can't talk to you because there is always some work left
If I do take a break and the work is not done for the day then I feel guilty
I can't do enough because after every topic that I get done I take a 20 mins break even if the topic itself is 40 mins
And this is really jeopardizing my relationship with you
9/28/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And also planning is very difficult because I just don't know how long some topic is going to take
9/28/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: Yaar
9/28/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: I am sorry that I am not as clear headed as you when it comes to planning these things
9/28/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: But I am trying
9/28/19, 11:07 AM - Kunj Behari Beriwala: And I am sorry
